\begin{abstract}
We present spatially and spectrally resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of gas and dust in the disk orbiting the pre-main sequence triple GW Ori. Model transitions to put precise constraint on the total stellar mass of XX. We use 35 years of radial velocity monitoring of the single-lined spectroscopic binary to rederive accurate constraints, yielding three components. Combining these two, yields a precise constraint on the primary stellar mass of XX. We show that this precise mass is inconsistent with the predictions of leading pre-main sequence evolutionary models based upon its observed photospheric properties. Regardless of the agreement, the GW~Ori system is undoubtedly young, less than 1~Myr. We put constraints on the orbital configuration of the triple system within the massive disk and discuss this in the context of star and planet formation.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

% SEAN: To try and expedite things and reduce iterations here, I've tried to better organize Keivan's list of things to explore into topical paragraphs that mesh with the direction of this article.  All of the "note" contents are still here, but some are commented out with a suggestion that they would make much more sense in the Discussion section of the paper (i.e., once we've derived some of the necessary metrics).

\todo{{\it narrowing (short) paragraph}}: general relevance of multiple stars; comment on lingering uncertainties in their formation (especially higher-order multiples).

\todo{{\it introduce GW Ori}}: among first known pre-main sequence SBs, associated with the $\lambda$ Ori complex (nominal age = 5 Myr; save discussion of membership for later!).  basic facts: composite spectral type = late G, SB1 with nominal period AB = 240 \citep{mathieu91}, long-term trend suggesting third body with C = 4000d.  IR interferometry finds tertiary \citep{berger11}.
% Keivan also was interested to know if it was an x-ray source; this would go here if there was some way to make it relevant, but I'm not sure what that would be in our context.

\todo{{\it mysterious stuff about GW Ori}}: has a disk and is doing weird stuff (can be brief here, since we don't really care about the details in this paper: Fang 2014 paper finds crazy activity and inner disk clearing, recent modeling by Sicilia-Aguilar).  dimmings like RW Aur, with associated RV deviations (see Shevchenko papers).
% Keivan had a note about KELT dimmings, but I believe that was to check with Joey (not been published; we will likely fold that into this paper).

\todo{{\it circle back to big picture/context}}: why GW Ori is interesting in the larger astrophysics landscape.  probably most interesting to mention here the nominal masses are large, and so its like a super-young version of Max Moe's multiple systems (possible SNe progenitors?).  also interesting from the perspective of forming high-order multiples (compact triple system).  finally note that its a particularly interesting test of pre-main sequence models at the high mass end of the IMF.  explain that its useful to get a mass measurement and why.

\todo{{\it paper overview}}: one sentence reminding people that we can use the disk to get the mass (cite our previous papers).  what data we have for GW Ori and what we will do with it here.  section breakdowns.


% Keivan's notes below are for something we should bring up in the discussion, after we have some numbers and are able to quantitatively revisit ages/memberships:

%\item Evolution of 5 Msun star from PMS tracks?? What age constraints are there from 5 Msun with late-G spectral type?
%\item Where does the nominal 5 Myr age for lambda Ori come from (see Dolan papers)?
%\item Is position and gamma velocity consistent with lambda Ori membership? Could it be in foreground Ori association?
%\item There is a parallax and also proper motions.

GW Ori was observed with the ALMA interferometer on 2015 May 14 (program ID 2012.1.00496.S), with 37 of the 12\,m main array antennas configured to span baselines of 23--558\,m.  The double sideband Band 6 receivers were employed in dual polarization mode, and the ALMA correlator was set up to process data in 4 spectral windows (SPWs).  Two of these SPWs, centered at 220.426 and 230.450\,GHz to observe the nearby $^{13}$CO and $^{12}$CO $J$=2--1 transitions (at rest frequencies of 220.399 and 230.538\,GHz, respectively), covered 234\,MHz of bandwidth in 3840 channels (a 61\,kHz channel spacing).  One other sampled 469\,MHz around 219.763\,GHz to observe the nearby C$^{18}$O $J$=2--1 transition (at rest frequency 219.560\,GHz) with 3840 channels (a 122\,kHz channel spacing).  The last SPW sampled the continuum in a 1.875\,GHz range around 231.956\,GHz using 128 coarse channels (a 15.625\,MHz channel spacing).

The observations cycled between GW Ori and the quasar J0510+1800 with a 7 minute cadence.  The quasar J0423-0120 and Ganymede were observed as bandpass and flux calibration sources, respectively, at the start of the execution block.  The total on-source integration time for GW Ori was 16 minutes.  The observing conditions were typical for Band 6 projects, with a precipitable water vapor level around 1.1\,mm.

The visibility data were calibrated with standard procedures using the {\sc CASA} software package (v4.4).  The raw, observed visibility phases were adjusted based on the contemporaneous measurements of water vapor radiometers, flagged when applicable, and then the bandpass shape in (and between) each SPW was calibrated based on the observations of J0423-0120.  The absolute amplitude scale was determined based on the observations of Ganymede.  The complex gain behavior of the array and atmosphere was corrected based on the repeated observations of J0510+1800.  The calibrated visibilities showed a strong continuum signal, suggesting that self-calibration could significantly improve the data quality.  An initial model based on a preliminary continuum image was used for two rounds of phase-only self-calibration (on 30\,s, then 6\,s intervals) and one additional round that included the amplitudes (on a 7 minute scan interval).  This self-calibration reduced the RMS noise level in the continuum by a factor of $\sim$40.  After applying the self-calibration tables to the entire dataset (channel by channel),  we parsed out data products for each individual emission tracer of interest.  A set of continuum visibilities was constructed by spectrally averaging the line-free channels in each SPW into $\sim$125\,MHz increments.  The spectral visibilities for the $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O lines were continuum-subtracted and regridded into 170\,m s$^{-1}$-wide channels in the LSRK restframe over a $\sim$10\,km s$^{-1}$ range around the line centers.

These fully reduced visibility sets were then imaged by Fourier inversion assuming a Briggs (robust=0.5) weighting scheme and deconvolution with the standard {\tt CLEAN} algorithm.  Some basic image properties for the synthesized continuum image and spectral line image cubes are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ims}.  The continuum and spectral line moment maps are shown together in Figure~\ref{fig:moments}, along with a comparison of the integrated spectra.  The channel maps for individual lines are compiled in Figure~\ref{fig:chanmaps}.

The 226\,GHz (1.3\,mm) continuum map shows a bright (flux density = 202\,mJy), compact but marginally resolved (deconvolved Gaussian FWHM $\approx 0\farcs9$) source centered on the GW Ori stellar system, with a peak intensity of 67\,mJy beam$^{-1}$ (S/N $\approx 1200$).  A crude estimate of the emission geometry (from a Gaussian fit to the visibilities) suggests an inclination of 35--40\degr\ from face-on, with the major axis oriented $\sim$170\degr\ E of N.

The CO isotopologue channel maps reveal bright (integrated intensities of 41.8, 5.7, and 0.8\,Jy\,km\,s$^{-1}$ for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O, respectively) and extended (FWHM $\sim 2\farcs5$) emission that is clearly in rotation around the continuum centroid, spanning a projected velocity range of $\pm$5\,km s$^{-1}$ from the line center.  The line emission is blueshifted to the south and redshifted to the north, consistent with the orientation estimated from the continuum emission.  The peak intensities for each line are $\sim$800, 290, and 55\,mJy beam$^{-1}$ in the brightest channels (peak S/N $\approx 130$, 35, and 14) for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O, respectively.  The $^{12}$CO channel maps show some clear evidence for structured contamination from the surrounding molecular cloud, particularly as a streamer to the west at LSRK velocities $\sim$11--13\,km s$^{-1}$ and some diffuse clumps to the north around 13--14\,km s$^{-1}$.  Those features are much fainter, but still present, in $^{13}$CO emission; they are not apparent in the C$^{18}$O maps.

\subsection{Optical Spectroscopy \label{sec:spectroscopy}}

\gw\ was monitored spectroscopically at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics for more than 35 years, beginning in 1981 November. A total of 208 spectra were gathered through 2009 April using three nearly identical echelle spectrographs (Digital Speedometers, DS; now decommissioned) with a resolving power of $R \approx 35,000$ mounted on three different telescopes: the 1.5m Tillinghast reflector at the Fred L.\ Whipple Observatory (Mount Hopkins, AZ), the 4.5m-equivalent Multiple Mirror Telescope (also on Mount Hopkins) before conversion to a monolithic mirror, and occasionally also on the 1.5m Wyeth reflector at the Oak Ridge Observatory (in the town of Harvard, MA).  Each instrument was equipped with an intensified photon-counting Reticon detector limiting the output to a single echelle order 45~\AA\ wide, which was centered on the region of the \ion{Mg}{1}\,b triplet at 5187~\AA\ \citep[see][]{latham92}. The signal-to-noise ratios of these observations range from 14 to 59 per resolution element of 8.5~\kms. Wavelength calibrations were based on exposures of a Thorium-Argon lamp taken before and after each science exposure. Reductions were performed with a dedicated pipeline, and the zero-point of the velocities was monitored regularly by means of exposures of the evening and morning twilight sky. A further 80 spectra of \gw\ were collected with the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph \citep[TRES;][]{furesz08}, a bench-mounted, fiber-fed echelle instrument mounted on the 1.5m Tillinghast reflector with a resolving power of $R \approx 44,000$ and delivering 51 orders covering the wavelength interval 3900--9100~\AA. These observations were made between 2010 November and 2016 April.  Signal-to-noise ratios at 5200~\AA\ range from 28 to 195 per resolution element of 6.8~\kms. Wavelength calibration was carried out as above, and reductions were performed as described by \cite{buchhave10}. Radial-velocity standard stars were observed each night to monitor the zero point and place it on the same system as the DS observations to within $\sim$0.1~\kms.

All of our spectra appear single-lined.  Radial velocities were measured by cross-correlation using the IRAF\footnote{IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.} task {\tt XCSAO} \citep{kurtz98}, with templates taken from a large library of calculated spectra based on model atmospheres by R.\ L.\ Kurucz \citep[see][]{nordstroem94,latham02}. These synthetic templates cover a 300~\AA\ region centered on the \ion{Mg}{1}\,b triplet, and are available for a wide range of effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$), surface gravities ($\log g$), metallicities ([Fe/H]), and rotational broadenings ($v \sin i$ when seen in projection). The optimal template was selected by running grids of cross-correlations over broad ranges in the template parameters, as described by \cite{torres02}, seeking the best match as measured by the peak cross-correlation coefficient averaged over all exposures. This was done separately for the DS and TRES spectra, using only the order centered on the \ion{Mg}{1}\,b line, for consistency.

In principle these template parameters may be interpreted as estimates of the physical properties of the star. In practice, however, the narrow wavelength range ($\sim$100~\AA\ for TRES, 45~\AA\ for DS) limits the analysis by introducing a degeneracy between temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity such that a match of nearly equal quality is obtained by slightly increasing or decreasing these template parameters in tandem. We therefore made the reasonable assumption that \gw\ has solar metallicity, as expected for young stars, and we held $\log g$ fixed at a range of values between 2.5 and 4.0, varied in steps of 0.5, and solved only for $T_{\rm eff}$ and $v \sin i$. The best fit was found for $\log g = 3.0$, for both the DS and TRES spectra, and the resulting temperatures and rotational broadenings were very similar: 5180~K and 43~\kms\ for DS, and 5210~K and 44~\kms\ for TRES. For the remainder of the paper we adopt consensus values of $T_{\rm eff} = 5200 \pm 200$~K and $v \sin i = 44 \pm 2~\kms$. Because of the strong dependence of temperature on the adopted surface gravity (and metallicity) we cannot rule out a bias in $T_{\rm eff}$, which may also have a contribution from veiling (not considered in our templates), if significant in the spectral region analyzed.  Radial velocities were based on a template with parameters nearest to those reported above ($T_{\rm eff} = 5250$~K, $v \sin i = 40~\kms$, $\log g = 3.0$); they are listed in Table~\ref{tab:RVs} in the heliocentric frame along with our uncertainty estimates from {\tt XCSAO}. The average internal errors for the DS and TRES velocities are 1.41 and 0.98~\kms, respectively.

\section{Analysis and Results}

\subsection{A Reconstruction of the Disk Velocity Field}

The primary goal of our analysis is to place concrete constraints on the key physical parameters of the GW Ori multiple star system.  One aspect of that analysis is to use the spatially and spectrally resolved molecular line emission observed with ALMA to tomographically reconstruct a model of the disk velocity field and use it to make a dynamical measurement of the system mass.  To do that, we follow the forward modeling procedures -- with some modifications as highlighted below -- described in detail by \citet{czekala15a,czekala16}, using the associated open-source software package {\tt DiskJockey}.\footnote{Available under an MIT license at \url{https://github.com/iancze/DiskJockey}.}

The annotation is the same as in Fig.~\ref{fig:chanmaps}.
  \label{fig:13co}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

The basis of the parametric physical model adopted in this approach is a radial surface density profile, $\Sigma(r)$, designed to mimic a simple theoretical description for a viscous accretion disk \citep{lyndenbell74,hartmann98}.  It decreases like $1/r$ interior to a characteristic radius $R_c$, and has an exponential taper $e^{-r/R_c}$ at larger radii.  The vertical distribution ($z$-direction) of these densities is controlled by the disk temperatures.  In this study, we generalize the previous {\tt DiskJockey} code to accommodate models with a vertical temperature gradient in order to better account for the observed emission in high quality ALMA datasets.  We follow the standard prescription in the literature \citep{dartois03,andrews12,rosenfeld13a} and define
\begin{equation}
	T(r, z) = T_m + (T_a - T_m)  \sin \left [ \frac{\pi z}{8 H} \right ]^4,
\end{equation}
where $T_m$ and $T_a$ are the midplane and ``atmosphere" radial temperature profiles, presumed to be power-laws with independent normalizations ($T_{m,0}$, $T_{a,0}$) and indices ($q_m$, $q_a$), and $H$ is the scale height calculated for $T_m$.  The density structure, $\rho(r, z)$, is determined by numerically integrating the hydrostatic equilibrium condition for this $T(r,z)$ structure at each radius (normalized by $\Sigma$).

To convert the total gas densities to molecule-specific values, we start with baseline abundances that are representative of the cold molecular interstellar medium: [$^{12}$CO/gas] = 10$^{-4}$, [$^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO] = 70, and [$^{12}$CO/C$^{18}$O] = 540 \citep[e.g.,][]{henkel94,prantzos96}.  We then follow \citet{qi08} to crudely account for depletions relative to these baselines associated with both photodissociation in the low-density atmosphere and freezeout onto dust grains at low temperatures.  Specifically, we set the CO abundance to zero for regions where the gas column densities (vertically integrated toward the midplane) are below $10^{21}$\,cm$^{-2}$, and we deplete the baseline abundance by a factor of 100 for the disk regions where $T<19$\,K.  

The disk kinematics are assumed to be Keplerian and dominated by the total stellar mass $M_{\ast}$, with a velocity field that appropriately accounts for the two-dimensional distribution of the emitting layer \citep[see][]{rosenfeld13a}.  The  line-spread function is characterized with a width defined by the quadrature sum of thermal and non-thermal ($\xi$; presumably turbulent) contributions.  

For any physical structure specified by these 8 parameters, \{$\Sigma_c$, $R_c$, $T_{m,0}$, $T_{a,0}$, $q_m$, $q_a$, $M_\ast$, $\xi$\}, we solve the molecular rate equations (assuming LTE) and ray-trace the associated emission into a set of high resolution channel maps using the radiative transfer package {\tt RADMC-3D} \citep{dullemond12}.  That ray-tracing requires that we specify 3 additional geometric parameters: the disk inclination to the line-of-sight ($i_d$), the position angle of the disk rotation axis projected on the sky ($\varphi_d$), and the LSRK systemic radial velocity ($v_r$).  The model channel maps are then Fourier transformed and sampled at the same spatial frequencies observed by ALMA.  The model quality with respect to the observed visibilities is then evaluated with a $\chi^2$ likelihood function, incorporating the nominal visibility weights.  We assume flat priors on all parameters except for $i_d$, where a simple geometric prior is adopted \citep{czekala16}.  We further enforce a criterion that $T_m \leq T_a$ to ensure a realistic model of disk heating.  The posterior distribution of these parameters is explored using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations with the affine invariant ensemble sampler proposed by \citet{goodman10}, as implemented in the {\tt emcee} code \citep{foreman-mackey13}.

In all of this analysis, we adopt a distance to GW Ori of $d = 414$\,pc \citep{menten07} to make the problem more computationally tractable.  The effects of this assumption are discussed further in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.  

Compared to previous similar work, the GW Ori modeling is considerably more computationally intensive.  Part of the reason lies with the higher dimensionality of the parameter-space, but much of it is also the fact that the disk is so physically large that the ray-tracing step to generate high resolution synthetic channel maps covering large angular scales is substantially more time-consuming.  The inference for an individual spectral line takes $\sim$30,000 CPU hours on \todo{specify cores, etc.}.  Given that restriction and the fact that the $^{12}$CO line is clearly contaminated by local cloud material, we restrict our analysis to {\it independent} inferences of the model parameters based on the $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O data only.

The inferred parameter values corresponding to the measurements of each spectral line are summarized together in Table~\ref{table:components}.  A comparison of the data and the best-fit models (and associated residuals) are presented in the form of channel maps in Figures~\ref{fig:13co} and \ref{fig:c18o} for $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O, respectively.  While overall the models successfully reproduce the observed emission, there are some interesting systematic residuals.  We will return to a discussion of their potential origins in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.  The inferred physical structures for each line are in mild disagreement, as might be expected for an over-simplified model based on data products that are sensitive to different regions of the disk.  Nevertheless, they both yield effectively identical constraints in the marginalized projection to the \{$M_\ast$, $i_d$\}-plane, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:posterior}, that is of most relevance to our stated goals.  Again, that is because the kinematic structure of the line emission has very little dependence on the density and temperature parameters \citep[see][]{rosenfeld12a,czekala15a}.      



\subsection{An Updated Model of the Stellar Orbits} \label{sec:orbit}

The discovery orbit of \gw\ by \cite{mathieu91}, with a period of
242 days, was based on a small subset of the same spectra used here,
covering slightly more than seven years. The present data set is six
times larger and extends the time coverage to nearly 35 years.
\cite{mathieu91} noted a drift in the residuals from their
spectroscopic orbit that they speculated could be due to a third
component, or perhaps an asymmetry in a massive circumbinary disk,
causing the reflex motion of the inner binary with a period exceeding
their time coverage. As our data set expanded over the years, our own
preliminary spectroscopic solutions for the 242-day orbit displayed an
increasingly clear periodic pattern in the residuals with a period of
about 11.5 years, strongly suggesting the presence of a third body in
the \gw\ system with a nearly circular orbit. Direct near-infrared
imaging by \cite{berger11} revealed the stellar nature of the third
component for the first time, and also resolved the inner binary.  Our
extended time coverage in radial velocities now enables us to derive a
robust spectroscopic orbit for the third star.

We used standard weighted non-linear least-squares techniques
\citep[e.g.,][]{press92} to solve for the elements of the inner and
outer Keplerian orbits simultaneously, assuming the inner binary acts
as a point mass in the outer orbit, and including the effects of light
travel time. Initial fits showed that a number of the measurements had
very large residuals, including instances of several consecutive
exposures over periods of a few days or weeks with residuals of the
same sign, possibly resulting from real phenomena such as flaring or
accretion events. A total of 23 such outliers were removed, and are
flagged in Table~\ref{tab:RVs}. The derived elements of the inner and
outer orbits are presented in Table~\ref{tab:elements}, along with
other properties derived from them. The residuals from our initial fit
indicated our formal velocity errors are slightly underestimated, so
for our final solution we have scaled them by a factor of 1.12 to
achieve a reduced $\chi^2$ of unity.

The period of the inner orbit is consistent with that of
\cite{mathieu91}, and the eccentricity is insignificant, as was
also found by them. On the other hand, the velocity semi-amplitude of
our inner orbit, $K_{\rm A} = 3.54 \pm 0.11~\kms$, is significantly
smaller than theirs ($K_{\rm A} = 4.7 \pm 0.3~\kms$), but similar to
the one by \cite{fang14} ($K_{\rm A} = 3.41 \pm 0.17~\kms$).
Graphical representations of our observations and the inner and outer
orbit models as a function of orbital phase are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:orbitin} and Figure~\ref{fig:orbitout}, respectively,
and a representation of the full motion as a function of time is seen

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{The Evolutionary State of GW Ori A}
Pre-main sequence evolutionary models are commonly used to infer the mass and age of young stars using measurements of their photospheric properties. We now perform this exercise for the GW~Ori system and evaluate the consistency of the model predictions with our measured dynamical masses for each component.

Given our inability to detect secondary or tertiary spectral lines in our optical spectra, we assume that all of the visible light can be attributed to the photosphere of GW~Ori~A. We adopt the photospheric properties of GW~Ori~A as determined by \citet{fang14}, $T_\mathrm{eff} = 5500 \pm 200\,\mathrm{K}$ and $L = 48 \pm 10\,L_\odot$. These photospheric properties clearly place GW~Ori~A in a high mass region of the Hertzsprung Russell Diagram (see Figure~\ref{fig:PMS}, left). For example, the MIST models suggest that GW~Ori~A is at least $3 M_\odot$.

% List the models.
We evaluate the following pre-main sequence models: \citet{choi16} models, \citet{dotter08}, \citet{tognelli11}, and \citet{siess00}. We do not include the \citet{baraffe15} models because they do not include models with sufficiently massive stars. We evaluate the predictions of the evolutionary models in a Bayesian manner, following \citet{jorgensen05}. These models deliver (among other quantities) the photospheric properties as a function of stellar mass and age,
e.g., $T_\mathrm{eff}(M_\ast, \tau)$ and $L(M_\ast, \tau)$. The posterior probability distribution is then found by evaluating the consistency of the model predictions for a given \{$M_\ast$, $\tau$\} pair with the measured photospheric properties by \citet{fang14}, multiplied by any priors on  \{$M_\ast$, $\tau$\}, in which case we have none. The resulting posterior probability distributions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PMS} and are listed in Table~\ref{table:agreement}\footnote{Our code used to perform this analysis is available under an MIT open source license here: \url{https://github.com/iancze/ScottiePippen}}. In general, all four models make similar predictions about GW~Ori~A, $M_A \sim 3.9 \pm 3\,M_\odot$ and $\tau = 0.6 \pm 0.3\,$Myr. We assess the probability of consistency between the model-predicted mass and our dynamical mass by evaluating $p(M_\mathrm{model} = M_\mathrm{dyn}) = \int_0^\infty p_\mathrm{model}(M) \, p_\mathrm{dyn}(M) \, \mathrm{d}M$. For most models, the predicted stellar mass is significantly less than our measured dynamical mass, $M_A = 4.40 \pm 0.18\,M_\odot$, and is consistent only at the $2\sigma$ level. As mentioned by \citet{fang14}, GW~Ori~A is in an earlier evolutionary stage than Herbig Be stars, although it will eventually become one.

Given the measured dynamical mass, GW~Ori~A is clearly underluminous. \emph{right}: The joint $M_A$ vs. $\tau$ posteriors with 1 and 2$\sigma$ contours, evaluated using a suite of pre-main sequence evolutionary model predictions.

\paragraph{Constraints on GW~Ori~B and GW~Ori~C}
It was known early on that GW~Ori was at least a spectroscopic binary \citet{mathieu91}, and subsequent radial-velocity follow up revealed the presence of a long-period tertiary (D. Latham, \emph{private communication}). In 2011, \citet{berger11} used the IOTA/IONIC3 interferometer to reconstruct an H-band image of the GW~Ori system, revealing all three components. The mean H-band flux ratio (computed as the weighted mean of all measurements) is $f_B/f_A = 0.57 \pm 0.05$ and $f_C/f_A = 0.23 \pm 0.01$. In Figure~\ref{fig:evolution}, we plot the ratio of effective temperatures and the computed flux ratios in Bessell I band and 2MASS H band. Bessell I roughly corresponds to the reddest echelle orders of the TRES spectrograph that we used to search for companion spectral lines. These flux ratios are generally very small, and if correct, provide an explanation for why we were unable to detect secondary or tertiary spectral lines in our searches. This means that the excess H-band flux is likely due to the presence of a circumstellar disk or accretion signatures above the photospheric emission of these stars, assuming that all stars are the same age.

It is interesting to discuss the inferred dynamical masses of these components with the measured H-band fluxes of Berger and the non-detections of spectral lines in the visible. This seems to be consistent with the interpretation by \citet{berger11} about the likely disk contamination, otherwise the masses of A and B would be inferred to be near equal. To our knowledge there has been no radial velocity monitoring of GW~Ori in the infrared.

\subsection{GW Ori as a triple system}
It is now clear that GW Ori is a massive triple star system ($M_\mathrm{tot} = 5.5\,M_\odot$), hosting a massive \citep[$M_\mathrm{disk} \sim 1.5\,M_\odot$;][]{mathieu95} and large ($r_c \sim 1000\,\mathrm{AU}$) disk. Given the observed composite spectrum and inferred mass ratios (Sec 4) it is also likely that the system is very young, making GW Ori an extremely interesting system to study in the context of star and planet theories about formation, migration, and stability.


\textbf{How did the various components form?}
Fragmentation can be due to cooling or accretion. Highly variable accretion can force disks up to the fragmentation threshold, where binarity is a frequent outcome. Consensus that GI-formed objects will become brown dwarfs or stellar binary companions \citep{kratter10}, due to moderate disk temperatures and active accretion, which will grow these GI formed objects to higher masses.

\citep{stamatellos09} BD formed in massive disks, but disks should be short lived. (Prediction for GW Ori lifetime?) Clearly disks are older than a few thousand years (their prediction). Predict lower mass objects are ejected by dynamical interactions. Disk fragmentation is a robust mechanism for brown dwarf formation. Again, most objects formed in disk grow to brown dwarf or hydrogen burning masses.

\citep{forgan13} objects that form via GI, 90\% are above deuterium burning limits. Population synthesis model. GI then tidal downsizing is not principal mode of planet formation, but is primary means of forming brown dwarfs and low mass stars at large $a$.

\citep{offner10}.
Turbulent fragmentation is dominant channel for binary formation for \emph{low mass} stars. Is disk accretion ever so violent that it induces disk fragmentation? The fact (assumption?) that everything is coplanar and low eccentricity are expected from fragmentation from a single disk. Conclude that binaries are formed via turbulent core fragmentation (not disk). Disks are not massive enough to have gravitational instability in the disk. \citet{offner10} cite Howe \& Clarke 2009 for a review of observations.

\citet{tokovinin97} finds that the distribution of mutual inclinations of the orbits in triple systems is inconsistent both with complete alignment of the inner and outer orbits, but also with independent inclinations of the two orbits.  However, we should note that this is for a population of much older systems, in which significant dynamical evolution could have occurred, particularly for the shorter-period systems.  The fact that GW Ori appears to have roughly-aligned, circular inner and outer orbits (!! does it?  to be confirmed) is suggestive of formation of one or both companions from the massive disk surrounding the system.  (Wild speculation here.)

Speculation from \citet{berger11} about whether the stellar system is actual stable.


\textbf{Is the disk stable today?}
\textbf{What does this mean for future observations: scattered light, high res, etc.}
Given the large disk mass and the massive components, it is natural to question whether these components formed from disk fragmentation due to gravitational instability, and whether the disk is itself Toomre stable today. Disks most likely to be stable are young and $M_d/M_\ast > 0.1$. Develop spiral arms. Thermodynamics drive instabilities, which may fragment into bound companions. Cold outer disk (free of MHD, usually) is the most likely to become gravitationally unstable. \todo{Estimate Toomre Q parameters from Kratter review, eqn 3. Seems like the disk is definitely Q unstable.} \citet{kratter16}.

Discussion of GW~Ori disk mass in context of \citet{andrews13}. Note Eisner 12, Sheehan and Eisner 14 discuss high disk masses in Taurus class I (younger sources).

Mann 15 also suggests young sources have more massive disks. NGC 2024.

\textbf{Eric}: Some notes from Eric from reading literature on what is known about triple systems.  Is this extreme?

While the ratio between the outer orbital period and the inner orbital period is smaller than in many hierarchical systems, it is not an outlier among triple systems.  In a detailed analysis of higher-order multiple systems, \citet{tokovinin97} found that the ratio $P_\mathrm{long} / P_{\rm short}$ in almost all systems was greater than 10, presumably reflecting which orbits are stable.  In GW Ori, this ratio is 16.

(Tokovinin has an updated catalog on his website with about twice as many systems as in the CDS version from this paper, but it would be non-trivial to figure out how to remake the above plot.  Not sure it's necessary.)

Among late B star primaries (which GW Ori A will be on the main sequence), 13\% of systems have multiplicity of three or higher \citep{eggleton08}; this fraction is roughly constant across spectral types B--G.


Bate 2012 on his big fragmentation simulation: ``In particular, despite the fact that no objects form closer than $\approx 10$ au from each other, at the end of the calculation there exist 21 binary systems and one triple system with separations $<10$ au.''

In his simulations, of the triples that form, the orbits are misaligned with each other (though three are $\leq 6$ degrees, and 8 out of 9 are $\leq 36$ degrees).

Bate:  ``Observations also indicate that eccentricities $e < 0.1$ are rare for periods greater than $\approx$ 100 d (separations $\gtrsim$ 1 au). Raghavan et al. (2010) find no binaries with $e < 0.1$ and orbital periods greater than 100 d, though they do find that the outer orbits of two triples and one quadruple have $e < 0.1$. Duquennoy \& Mayor (1991) and Raghavan et al. (2010) also find that the upper-eccentricity envelope is dominated by components of triple systems, possibly due to the action of the Kozai mechanism (Kozai 1962).''

Important for us to see what constraints we have on eccentricity of the orbits.



\subsection{The inner ~100 \,AU of the GW~Ori system} \label{sec:inner disk}

CO sub-mm excess.

Najita's blended fundamental emission peaks \citep{najita03}, while \citet{bast11} suggest that these might actually be the blended profiles of emission originating from physically distinct regions. In this case, perhaps individual circumstellar disks around the A and B stars. Or, the CO fundamental emission is consistent with with radius at the inner edge of the circumtriple disk, cleared by the C component. The tertiary star makes a complicated accretion flow than that studied for other well-known binaries \citep[e.g., DQ~Tau;]{artymowicz94,mathieu97}.

Photometric eclipses. This complicated tertiary flow may also contribute to photometric eclipses seen in the optical. Not all are periodic, but some regularity with period? Can we record what orbital phases they occur at? Maybe there is some correlation with A and B.
