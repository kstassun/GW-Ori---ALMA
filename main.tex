\begin{abstract}
We present spatially and spectrally resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of gas and dust in the disk orbiting the pre-main sequence triple GW Ori. Model transitions to put precise constraint on the total stellar mass of XX. We use 35 years of radial velocity monitoring of the single-lined spectroscopic binary to rederive accurate constraints, yeilding three components. Combining these two, yields a precise constraint on the primary stellar mass of XX. We show that this precise mass is inconsistent with the predictions of leading pre-main sequence evolutionary models based upon its observed photospheric properties. Regardless of the agreement, the GW~Ori system is undoubtedly young, less than 1~Myr. We put constraints on the orbital configuration of the triple system within the massive disk and discuss this in the context of star and planet formation.

\section{Introduction -- {\bf Keivan} \label{sec:intro}}

\noindent
{\bf Keivan's things to explore:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Nominal periods: AB = 240d, C = 4000d.
\item Evolution of 5 Msun star from PMS tracks?? What age constraints are there from 5 Msun with late-G spectral type?
\item Where does the nominal 5 Myr age for lambda Ori come from (see Dolan papers)?
\item Is position and gamma velocity consistent with lambda Ori membership? Could it be in foreground Ori association?
\item Other systems that are HAeBe primary, T Tauri secondary, and tertiary -- or main sequence equivalents? (Nominal masses are 5, 0.5, 0.5 Msun). See Maxwell Moe papers (B stars with TTS companions).
\item Dimmings like RW Aur, with associated RV deviations --- Shevchenko papers.
\item KELT dimmings??
\item There is a parallax and also proper motions.
\item Tertiary has been seen by Berger et al 2011... flux ratios.
\item Fang 2014 -- VLT spectra, accretion line diagnostics, SED modeling, disk wind? Gap flows.
\item X-ray source?

\section{Analysis and Results}

\subsection{CO Disk Modeling}

We analyze the \twelve, \thirteen, and \eighteen\ molecular line observations using the \texttt{DiskJockey} package \citep{czekala15a}\footnote{Open source under an MIT license at \url{https://github.com/iancze/DiskJockey}.} to infer the total stellar mass and place constraints on the disk structure. Briefly, our approach works by forward-modeling the millimeter interferometric observations of molecular line emission with a parametric description of the disk structure, temperature, and velocity field. For a given set of parameters, the radiative transfer package \texttt{RADMC-3D} \citep{dullemond12} is used to solve the ray-trace a given disk structure and generate high-resolution channel maps. These images are then Fourier transformed and sampled at the same $u-v$ locations as the ALMA observations. The goodness of fit for each model is evaluated using a $\chi^2$ likelihood function, which incorporates the visibility weights determined from the radiometer equation. After multiplying by a geometrical prior on disk inclination \citep{czekala16}, this posterior distribution is explored using an MCMC ensemble sampler \citep{goodman10,foreman-mackey13}.

Further description of our standard modeling approach can be found in \citep{czekala15a,czekala16}. Motivated by the high quality and well-resolved observations of multiple CO isotopologues, we extend the package to include a disk model with a vertical temperature gradient \citep[e.g.,][]{dartois03}. Instead of assuming that the temperature at each radius is vertically isothermal, as before, we now include a parameterization \citep[following][]{rosenfeld13a,williams14} that allows a smooth transition from a ``midplane'' temperature to an ``atmosphere'' temperature. These two boundary temperatures are described by power laws
\begin{equation}
	T_m(r) = T_{m,10} \left ( \frac{r}{10\,\textrm{AU}} \right )^{-q_m}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	T_a(r) = T_{a,10} \left ( \frac{r}{10\,\textrm{AU}} \right )^{-q_a}
\end{equation}
and we enforce that $T_{m,10} \leq T_{a,10}$. The height of the atmosphere $z_q$ is calculated as a multiple $h$ of the disk scale height, $z_q(r) = h H(r)$, where we fix $h = 4$. Between the midplane ($z$$=$$0$) and atmosphere the temperature is given by
\begin{equation}
	T(r, z) = T_m + (T_a - T_m)  \sin \left [ \frac{\pi z}{2 z_q} \right ]^{2 \delta}
\end{equation}
where we fix $\delta = 2$. At altitudes above $z_q$, the disk is isothermal $T(r, z > z_q) = T_a(r)$. Because we are now considering large heights above the midplane, we more accurately calculate the velocity using the radial distance to the central stellar mass
\begin{equation}
	v^2(r, z) = \frac{G M_\mathrm{tot}}{(r^2 + z^2)^{1/2}}.
\end{equation}
The radial surface density profile of the disk is still set by the standard density prescription of $\Sigma(r)$ \citep[see][]{czekala15a}, however now the vertical density structure is calculated by solving the equation for (vertical) hydrostatic equilibrium
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \ln \rho}{\ln z} = - \left [\left (\frac{G M_\ast z}{(r^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} \right) \left ( \frac{\mu m_H}{k T} \right ) + \frac{\partial \ln T}{\partial z} \right].
\end{equation}
This ordinary differential equation (ODE) is solved numerically to yield an unnormalized vertical density profile. The normalization is found by imposing the condition that $\Sigma(r) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \rho(r, z)\, \mathrm{d}z$. To incorporate the effects of photodissociation, wherever the column density of gas above a height is less than \todo{XX}, we set the CO abundance to zero. This height $z_\mathrm{phot}$ is found by the solution to the equation $\sigma_\mathrm{phot}(r) = \int_{z_\mathrm{phot}}^\infty \rho(r, z)\, \mathrm{d}z.$

Lastly, we account for CO freezeout onto dust grains by decreasing the CO abundance by a factor of $100$ wherever the disk temperature is below $19\,$K. Because the distance to GW~Ori is precisely known \citep[$414 \pm 7\,\textrm{pc}$,][]{menten07}, we reduce the dimensionality of the posterior probability distribution and save computational time by keeping the distance to the source fixed. Since uncertainty in the source distance translates into $M_\ast$ uncertainty in a linear manner, this is a small effect on the precision of $M_\ast$ compared to the statistical uncertainty from the CO analysis.

We model the \twelve, \thirteen, and \eighteen\ data independently, and each posterior exploration for take roughly 30,000 CPU hours of computation on the Harvard Odyssey cluster, including discarding samples for burn-in. For more details about other aspects of the modeling procedure, please see \citet{czekala15a,czekala16}. Although the isotopologues are modeled independently, the analyses yield similar constraints on the geometrical disk parameters and most importantly agree on the central stellar mass $M_\mathrm{tot}$ and the disk inclination $i_d$. The models differ slightly in their inference of the temperature structure of the disk. The best-fit parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{table:components}, and channel maps synthesized using the best-fit models are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:chmaps_CO}, Figure~\ref{fig:chmaps_13CO}, and Figure~\ref{fig:chmaps_C18O}. The joint posteriors for $M_\mathrm{tot}$ vs. $i_d$ for the isotopologues are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:posterior}.

% Discussion of fit residuals
It is likely that \twelve\ emission suffers from cloud contamination. \todo{explain why}.

While the \thirteen\ and \eighteen\ model fits are in excellent agreement with the data, given the high sensitivity of the observations there are a few notable residuals that merit discussion (see Figures~\ref{fig:chmaps_13CO}~and~\ref{fig:chmaps_C18O}). At low velocities, there is a consistent excess of emission in the central region of the disk. This emission cannot be explained simply by a mis-fit surface density profile, since material in the central regions of the disk would be moving at orbital velocities. We speculate that this emission could be originating from an outflow moving along the line of sight, or perhaps a warp or accretion stream. Likewise, there is a possibility that this could be due to a smaller, unresolved, face-on disk in the central region. Given the recent discussion of dipper systems (\todo{Ansdel}), this would be an interesting connection.

Warmer estimates show that.

As mentioned by \citet{fang14}, GW~Ori~A is in an earlier evolutionary stage than Herbig Be stars, although it will eventually become one.

\subsection{GW Ori as a triple system}

{\it Some notes from Eric from reading literature on what is known about triple systems.  Is this extreme?}

While the ratio between the outer orbital period and the inner orbital period is smaller than in many hierarchical systems, it is not an outlier among triple systems.  In a detailed analysis of higher-order multiple systems, \citet{tokovinin97} found that the ratio $P_{\rm long} / P_{\rm short}$ in almost all systems was greater than 10, presumably reflecting which orbits are stable.  In GW Ori, this ratio is 16.

(Tokovinin has an updated catalog on his website with about twice as many systems as in the CDS version from this paper, but it would be non-trivial to figure out how to remake the above plot.  Not sure it's necessary.)

Among late B star primaries (which GW Ori A will be on the main sequence), 13\% of systems have multiplicity of three or higher \citep{eggleton08}; this fraction is roughly constant across spectral types B--G.

\citet{tokovinin97} finds that the distribution of mutual inclinations of the orbits in triple systems is inconsistent both with complete alignment of the inner and outer orbits, but also with independent inclinations of the two orbits.  However, we should note that this is for a population of much older systems, in which significant dynamical evolution could have occurred, particularly for the shorter-period systems.  The fact that GW Ori appears to have roughly-aligned, circular inner and outer orbits (!! does it?  to be confirmed) is suggestive of formation of one or both companions from the massive disk surrounding the system.  (Wild speculation here.)

Offner et al 2010 is probably important for us to look at regarding fragmentation vs.\ disk instability.  They also cite Howe \& Clarke 2009 for a review of observations.

Bate 2012 on his big fragmentation simulation: ``In particular, despite the fact that no objects form closer than $\approx 10$ au from each other, at the end of the calculation there exist 21 binary systems and one triple system with separations $<10$ au.''

In his simulations, of the triples that form, the orbits are misaligned with each other (though three are $\leq 6$ degrees, and 8 out of 9 are $\leq 36$ degrees).

Bate:  ``Observations also indicate that eccentricities $e < 0.1$ are rare for periods greater than $\approx$ 100 d (separations $\gtrsim$ 1 au). Raghavan et al. (2010) find no binaries with $e < 0.1$ and orbital periods greater than 100 d, though they do find that the outer orbits of two triples and one quadruple have $e < 0.1$. Duquennoy \& Mayor (1991) and Raghavan et al. (2010) also find that the upper-eccentricity envelope is dominated by components of triple systems, possibly due to the action of the Kozai mechanism (Kozai 1962).''

Important for us to see what constraints we have on eccentricity of the orbits.

Speculation from \citet{berger11} about whether this system is actual stable.
