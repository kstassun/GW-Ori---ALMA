\begin{abstract}
We present spatially and spectrally resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of gas and dust in the large disk orbiting the pre-main sequence hierarchical triple star system GW Ori. We forward-model the \thirteen\ and \eighteen\ $J$=2--1 transitions to precisely constrain the total stellar mass to be $5.29 \pm 0.09\,M_\odot$, and the circumtriple disk inclination to be $i_\mathrm{disk} = 137.6 \pm 2.0^\circ$. We use 35 years of optical spectra to derive new radial velocity (RV) solutions and apply spectroscopic disentangling techniques to reveal that the A and B components of \obj\ form a double-lined spectroscopic binary ($P_\mathrm{in}$=$241.50\pm0.05$ days) with an outer hierarchical triple ($P_\mathrm{out}$=$4218\pm50$ days).
Combining the disk and RV measurements with three epochs of archival astrometry yields precise ($\pm 0.3\,M_\odot$) constraints on the individual stellar masses ($M_\mathrm{A}$=$2.7 M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{B}$=$1.7 M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{C}$=$0.9 M_\odot$) and strongly indicates that at least one and possibly both stellar orbits are misaligned with the circumtriple disk by as much as $45^\circ$. We also compile a 30-year $V$-band light curve, which reveals several new $\sim$30~day eclipse events 0.1 - 0.7~mag in depth. We find a significant 0.2 mag sinusoidal oscillation of the $V$-band flux clearly phased with the outer orbital period, suggesting that the A-B pair is screened by variable degrees of obscuration from material in the inner disk as the outer orbit approaches apoastron.
Lastly, we conclude that our measurements of stellar masses and photospheric properties are consistent with the predictions of leading pre-main sequence evolutionary models, and indicate that the \obj\ system is $1.1\pm0.3$\,Myr old.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Pre-main sequence stars in multiple systems--for which it is possible to precisely measure their fundamental stellar properties through dynamical means--serve as touchstones for understanding the final stages of stellar formation and the conditions under which planetary systems are assembled. While recent decades have seen steady progress in understanding binary formation in general, lingering uncertainties still remain about the characteristics of young close-in spectroscopic binaries and higher order systems \citep{duchene13}.
\obj, a member of the $\lambda$ Orionis OB star forming complex \citep{dolan00,dolan01,dolan02}, was one of the first T Tauri stars to be revealed as a spectroscopic binary, with a composite G spectral type and an orbital period of 240 days \citep{mathieu91}. Long term radial velocity monitoring hinted at the presence of a third body in the system with a period of $\sim$10\,years and was subsequently confirmed by infrared interferometry \citep{berger11}. The most recent and precise measurements of the distance to Orion Nebula Complex is a VLBA parallax measurement of $388\pm5\,$pc \citep{kounkel17}, which we adopt as the distance to \obj.

A reservoir of circumstellar material orbiting \obj\ was inferred from near and far-infrared emission in excess of the stellar photosphere \citep{mathieu91}, and was subsequently confirmed by a strong single-dish detection of the dust continuum at sub-millimeter wavelengths, suggesting the presence of a massive circumstellar disk \citep[$M_\mathrm{disk} \gtrsim 0.1\,M_\odot$;][]{mathieu95}. This detection provided a natural explanation for the  quasi-periodic photometric dimminings of \obj, which were observed to occur with $\sim$30\,day durations and were suspected to be due from material in a circumstellar disk around the secondary occulting the primary star at edge-on inclinations \citep[requiring orbital inclinations of $i \approx 90^\circ$;][]{shevchenko92,shevchenko98}.
\citet{fang17} spatially resolved the disk with Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of the dust continuum and CO isotopologues, and revealed it to be massive ($M_\mathrm{disk} = 0.12\,M_\odot$) and large, with the CO gas significantly more extended ($r_\mathrm{gas} \sim 1300\,\mathrm{au}$) than the dust ($r_\mathrm{dust} \sim 400\,\mathrm{au}$), and clearly encircling all three stars. However, they found the circumtriple disk to be at an \emph{intermediate} inclination to the line of sight ($i_\mathrm{disk} \approx 35^\circ$), challenging the assumption that the \obj\ system is viewed with an edge-on geometry and instead suggesting that more complex dynamics are at play in the innermost radii of the system.
Indeed, this adds to the collection of other indirect evidence pointing to a complicated geometry in the inner disk: a spectral energy distribution (SEDs) whose mid-infrared fluxes are variable on the timescale of years \citep{fang14}, and mid-infrared spectroscopic detections of CO fundamental emission with line profiles that have both a narrow and broad component, requiring a complicated emission region and temperature structure in the inner disk \citep{najita03}.
% There is a paper about \ion{Mg}{2} observations from IUE and HST on GW Ori, which include it as part of a survey. I'm not sure if there is much we say about it in this introduction, other than there is a warm wind at several au. \citep{lopez-martinez15}.


% \todo{{\it circle back to big picture/context}}: why GW Ori is interesting in the larger astrophysics landscape.  probably most interesting to mention here the nominal masses are large, and so its like a super-young version of Max Moe's multiple systems (possible SNe progenitors?).  also interesting from the perspective of forming high-order multiples (compact triple system).  finally note that its a particularly interesting test of pre-main sequence models at the high mass end of the IMF.  explain that its useful to get a mass measurement and why.
Beyond resolving outstanding questions about its architecture, given its large nominal primary mass but late composite spectral type \citep[$M_\mathrm{A} = 3.9\,M_\odot$, SpT = G8;][]{fang14,fang17}, the \obj\ system presents an excellent opportunity to obtain a precise dynamical mass measurement of a high mass star at a very young age. Precise dynamical masses, especially on the pre-Main Sequence, are crucial to calibrating the photospheric predictions (e.g., $T_\mathrm{eff}$, $L$) of stellar evolutionary models, and the region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) occupied by \obj~A is particularly sparsely populated with benchmark systems. \obj\ presents an excellent target for benchmarking because three independent dynamical mass techniques can be brought to bear on it simultaneously:
radial velocity monitoring, which constrain the mass ratios of the stars \citep{mathieu91,fang14}; astrometric monitoring, which provides the inclinations of the orbits and when coupled with radial velocity measurements can reveal the individual masses of the stars \citep{berger11};
and the disk-based dynamical mass technique \citep[e.g.,][]{rosenfeld12b,czekala15a,czekala16}, which directly measures the total stellar mass but unlike the first two techniques does not require long-term monitoring, instead the results can be obtained with a single resolved sub-mm observation---an important consideration given the long orbital periods involved.

In this paper, we report resolved sub-mm observations of the \obj\ system with the ALMA interferometer, which confirm the results of \citet{fang17} in finding a large and massive protoplanetary disk. We forward-model the ALMA observations to precisely infer the total mass of the enclosed stars and the disk inclination. We re-analyze 35 years of optical spectra to reveal \obj\ as a low semi-amplitude spectroscopic binary, and derive updated orbital constraints on \obj\ A, B, and C to conclude that the A-B orbit and possibly the AB - C orbit are strongly misaligned with the circumtriple disk. Adding in three epochs of astrometry from \citet{berger11} in a joint fit reinforces these conclusions. We evaluate our mass measurements of the stars in context with their photospheric properties to determine their agreement with leading pre-main sequence models. We also present an updated light curve with a 30-year baseline, which shows several new eclipse events. We conclude by discussing the structure and orientation of the protoplanetary disk with respect to the putative orbital inclinations of the stellar components and place the quasi-period eclipsing nature of \obj\ in the context of other recently discovered ``dipper'' stars \citep[e.g.,][]{ansdell16b,ansdell16a}.

GW Ori was observed with the ALMA interferometer on 2015 May 14 (program ID 2012.1.00496.S), with 37 of the 12\,m main array antennas configured to span baselines of 23--558\,m.  The double sideband Band 6 receivers were employed in dual polarization mode, and the ALMA correlator was set up to process data in 4 spectral windows (SPWs).  Two of these SPWs, centered at 220.426 and 230.450\,GHz to observe the nearby $^{13}$CO and $^{12}$CO $J$=2--1 transitions (at rest frequencies of 220.399 and 230.538\,GHz, respectively), covered 234\,MHz of bandwidth in 3840 channels (a 61\,kHz channel spacing).  One other sampled 469\,MHz around 219.763\,GHz to observe the nearby C$^{18}$O $J$=2--1 transition (at rest frequency 219.560\,GHz) with 3840 channels (a 122\,kHz channel spacing).  The last SPW sampled the continuum in a 1.875\,GHz range around 231.956\,GHz using 128 coarse channels (a 15.625\,MHz channel spacing).

The observations cycled between GW Ori and the quasar J0510+1800 with a 7 minute cadence.  The quasar J0423-0120 and Ganymede were observed as bandpass and flux calibration sources, respectively, at the start of the execution block.  The total on-source integration time for GW Ori was 16 minutes.  The observing conditions were typical for Band 6 projects, with a precipitable water vapor level around 1.1\,mm.

The visibility data were calibrated with standard procedures using the {\sc CASA} software package (v4.4).  The raw, observed visibility phases were adjusted based on the contemporaneous measurements of water vapor radiometers, flagged when applicable, and then the bandpass shape in (and between) each SPW was calibrated based on the observations of J0423-0120.  The absolute amplitude scale was determined based on the observations of Ganymede.  The complex gain behavior of the array and atmosphere was corrected based on the repeated observations of J0510+1800.  The calibrated visibilities showed a strong continuum signal, suggesting that self-calibration could significantly improve the data quality.  An initial model based on a preliminary continuum image was used for two rounds of phase-only self-calibration (on 30\,s, then 6\,s intervals) and one additional round that included the amplitudes (on a 7 minute scan interval).  This self-calibration reduced the RMS noise level in the continuum by a factor of $\sim$40.  After applying the self-calibration tables to the entire dataset (channel by channel),  we parsed out data products for each individual emission tracer of interest.  A set of continuum visibilities was constructed by spectrally averaging the line-free channels in each SPW into $\sim$125\,MHz increments.  The spectral visibilities for the $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O lines were continuum-subtracted and regridded into 170\,m s$^{-1}$-wide channels in the LSRK restframe over a $\sim$10\,km s$^{-1}$ range around the line centers.

These fully reduced visibility sets were then imaged by Fourier inversion assuming a Briggs (robust=0.5) weighting scheme and deconvolution with the standard {\tt CLEAN} algorithm.  Some basic image properties for the synthesized continuum image and spectral line image cubes are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ims}.  The continuum and spectral line moment maps are shown together in Figure~\ref{fig:moments}, along with a comparison of the integrated spectra.  The channel maps for individual lines are compiled in Figure~\ref{fig:chanmaps}.

The 226\,GHz (1.3\,mm) continuum map shows a bright (flux density = 202\,mJy), compact but marginally resolved (deconvolved Gaussian FWHM $\approx 0\farcs9$) source centered on the GW Ori stellar system, with a peak intensity of 67\,mJy beam$^{-1}$ (S/N $\approx 1200$). Our integrated flux density measurement is consistent with that of \citet[$255 \pm 60$\,mJy]{mathieu95},  but marginally discrepant with that of \citet[$320 \pm 64$\,mJy]{fang17}. A crude estimate of the emission geometry (from a Gaussian fit to the visibilities) suggests an inclination of 35--40\degr\ from face-on, with the major axis oriented $\sim$170\degr\ E of N.

The CO isotopologue channel maps reveal bright (integrated intensities of 41.8, 5.7, and 0.8\,Jy\,km\,s$^{-1}$ for $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O, respectively) and extended (FWHM $\sim 2\farcs5$) emission that is clearly in rotation around the continuum centroid, spanning a projected velocity range of $\pm$5\,km s$^{-1}$ from the line center.  The line emission is blueshifted to the south and redshifted to the north, consistent with the orientation estimated from the continuum emission.
The peak intensities for each line are $\sim$800, 290, and 55\,mJy beam$^{-1}$ in the brightest channels (peak S/N $\approx 130$, 35, and 14) for \twelve, \thirteen, and \eighteen, respectively. The \twelve\ channel maps show some clear evidence for structured contamination from the surrounding molecular cloud, particularly as a streamer to the west at LSRK velocities $\sim$11--13\,km s$^{-1}$ and some diffuse clumps to the north around 13--14\,km s$^{-1}$, confirming the ``tail''-like structure seen by \citet{fang17}.  These features are much fainter, but still present, in $^{13}$CO emission; they are not apparent in the C$^{18}$O maps.

\subsection{Optical Spectroscopy \label{subsec:spectroscopy}}

\obj\ was monitored spectroscopically at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics for more than 35 years, beginning in 1981 November. A total of 203 usable spectra were gathered through 2009 April using three nearly identical echelle spectrographs (Digital Speedometers, DS; now decommissioned) with a resolving power of $R \approx 35,000$ mounted on three different telescopes: the 1.5m Tillinghast reflector at the Fred L.\ Whipple Observatory (Mount Hopkins, AZ), the 4.5m-equivalent Multiple Mirror Telescope (also on Mount Hopkins) before conversion to a monolithic mirror, and occasionally on the 1.5m Wyeth reflector at the Oak Ridge Observatory (in the town of Harvard, MA).  Each instrument was equipped with an intensified photon-counting Reticon detector limiting the output to a single echelle order 45~\AA\ wide, which was centered on the region of the \ion{Mg}{1}\,b triplet at 5187~\AA\ \citep[see][]{latham92}. The signal-to-noise ratios of these observations range from 14 to 59 per resolution element of 8.5~\kms, with a median of 41. Wavelength calibrations were based on exposures of a Thorium-Argon lamp taken before and after each science exposure. Reductions were performed with a dedicated pipeline, and the zero-point of the velocities was monitored regularly by means of exposures of the evening and morning twilight sky. The original analysis of \cite{mathieu91} used a subset of 45 of these spectra. A further 79 usable spectra of \obj\ were collected with the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph \citep[TRES;][]{furesz08}, a bench-mounted, fiber-fed echelle instrument attached to the 1.5m Tillinghast reflector and providing a resolving power of $R \approx 44,000$, delivering 51 orders covering the wavelength interval 3900--9100~\AA. These observations were made between 2010 November and 2017 April.  Signal-to-noise ratios at 5200~\AA\ range from 28 to 195 per resolution element of 6.8~\kms, with a median of 74. Wavelength calibration was carried out as above, and reductions were performed as described by \cite{buchhave10}. Radial-velocity standard stars were observed each night to monitor the zero point and place it on the same system as the DS observations to within $\sim$0.1~\kms.

All of our spectra appeared initially to be single-lined, with broad features indicative of significant rotation. Preliminary radial-velocity measurements were therefore made with standard one-dimensional cross-correlation techniques, as in the analysis of \cite{mathieu91}. However, several pieces of evidence suggested it should be possible to detect the lines of the secondary in the 240 day binary. In particular, the fairly large flux ratio of $f_B/f_A = 0.57 \pm 0.05$ (weighted average) reported by \cite{berger11} in the $H$-band, when translated to the optical, would still be significant for any reasonable assumption on the temperatures of the stars, making our non-detection of the secondary somewhat surprising. Furthermore, those same authors proposed that the system is observed nearly face-on, which would lead to strong line blending that could explain our lack of detection despite the sizable brightness of the secondary.
Additionally, our efforts to disentangle the spectra described later (\S\ref{subsec:disentangle}) indicated the primary and secondary are indeed separable. Finally, we learned of a detection by others of double lines in targeted high-resolution near-infrared spectra of \obj\ (L.\ Prato, private communication).

Based on these indications we re-examined our spectra with TODCOR, a two-dimensional cross-correlation algorithm designed to minimize biases in the radial velocities due to line blending, and succeeded in detecting the secondary. As anticipated, the lines of the two stars are always heavily blended, which causes a strong degeneracy between the adopted rotational line broadening for the templates (see below), the velocity amplitudes, the adopted temperatures, and the flux ratio. To measure radial velocities we adopted synthetic templates for the primary and secondary from the PHOENIX library of \cite{husser13}, broadened to match the resolution of our spectra. For the TRES observations we restricted our analysis to the 100~\AA\ order centered on the \ion{Mg}{1}\,b triplet, both for consistency with the analysis of the DS spectra, which cover only a 45~\AA\ window centered on this region, and because experience shows that it contains most of the information on the velocities. The one-dimensional cross-correlations needed to construct the 2-D correlation function in TODCOR were computed using the IRAF\footnote{IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.} task {\tt XCSAO} \citep{kurtz98}. The template parameters were selected based on an analysis of the stronger TRES spectra, as follows. For the primary star we adopted a temperature of $T_{\rm eff} = 5700$~K proposed by \cite{mathieu91}, along with $\log g = 3.0$ and solar metallicity, although the latter has minimal effect. The same composition and surface gravity were used for the secondary.
The rotational broadening ($v \sin i$) of the primary, the secondary temperature, and the secondary $v \sin i$ were then determined by running extensive grids of 2-D cross-correlations over broad ranges in each parameter in a manner similar to that described by \cite{torres02}, seeking the best match as measured by the peak cross-correlation coefficient averaged over all exposures. For each combination of template parameters we also determined the flux ratio that maximizes the correlation.

In this way we determined a best-fit secondary temperature of $T_{\rm eff} = 4800 \pm 200$~K, and $v \sin i$ values for the primary and secondary of 40 and 45~\kms, respectively, with estimated uncertainties of 5~\kms. The measured flux ratio in the \ion{Mg}{1}\,b 5187~\AA\ region is $f_B/f_A = 0.25 \pm 0.05$. While in principle these temperatures and $v \sin i$ values are merely free parameters that provide the best match to the observed spectra, in the following we interpret them also as estimates of the physical properties of the stars. The radial velocities we measured from our DS and TRES spectra with these parameters are reported in Table~\ref{tab:RVs}, along with their uncertainties.
Typical errors for the primary and secondary are 1.0 and 2.7~\kms\ for TRES, and 2.5 and 8.7~\kms\ for the DS measurements. Despite the use of TODCOR, we reiterate that the severe line blending at all phases of the inner orbit caused by a combination of rotational broadening and small velocity amplitudes makes the radial velocities very susceptible to errors in the template parameters (particularly $v \sin i$) and in the adopted flux ratio, and as a result the orbital elements presented later may suffer from systematic errors not included in the statistical uncertainties.
Nevertheless, as a consistency check we used PHOENIX spectra from \cite{husser13} for the primary and secondary stellar parameters given above to extrapolate our measured flux ratio at 5187~\AA\ to the near infrared, and obtained an $H$-band value of $f_B/f_A = 0.57 \pm 0.12$. While less precise than the \cite{berger11} measurement, the agreement is excellent.

\subsection{Time-series Photometry}
We have assembled a $\sim$30 year high cadence lightcurve of \obj\ by drawing from several ongoing photometric surveys as well as archival observations. In this section we present the sources of our photometric data and their reduction.

\subsubsection{Maidanak Observatory}
\todo{Text from Grankin.}

\subsubsection{KELT}
The Kilodregree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) project uses two telescopes to survey over 70\% of the entire sky searching for transiting planets around bright stars (8$<$V$<$11). The telescopes, located in Sonoita, AZ (KELT-North) and Sutherland, South Africa (KELT-South), have a 42mm Mamiya 645-series wide-angle lens resulting in a $26^{\circ}$ $\times$ $26^{\circ}$ field-of-view (FOV), and a 23$\arcsec$ pixel scale. Both telescopes use a broad $R$-band filter. KELT observes using a paramount ME German equatorial mount with a 180$^{\circ}$ meridian flip; therefore KELT observes in either a ``east'' or ``west'' orientation. The telescope optics are not perfectly axisymmetric, and so the point spread function (PSF) changes from one orientation to the other. Throughout the data reduction process, the east and west observations are treated as though they were acquired from separate telescopes. See \citet{Siverd12} and \citet{Kuhn16} for a detailed description of the KELT observing strategy and reduction process. \obj\ was located in KELT-South field 05 ($\alpha$ =  06hr 07m 48.0s, $\delta$ = $+3^{\circ}$ 00$\arcmin$ 00$\arcsec$) and was observed 2889 times from UT 2010 February 28 until UT 2015 April 09, with a median error of 0.005 mag.

\subsubsection{ASAS}
Using two observing location, in Las Campanas, Chile and Haleakala, Maui, the All-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) project was designed to observe the entire sky to a limiting optical magnitude of 14. The two observatory setups each contained a wide-field Minolta 200/2.8 APO-G telephoto lenses with a 2K$\times$2K Apogee CCD and both observed simultaneously in $B$- and $V$-band. The telescope and camera set up correspond to a 8.8$^{\circ}\times8.8^{\circ}$ field-of-view. ASAS observed GW Ori in the $V$-band from UT 2001 March 11 until UT 2009 November 29, obtaining 480 observations with a median per-point error of 0.036 mag.

\subsubsection{ASAS-SN}
Focused on the discovery and characterization of SuperNovae, the the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, \citet{Shappee14}) surveys the entire sky down to $V \sim 17$ mag every $\sim$2 days. Hosted by the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) at Mount Haleakala, Hawaii and the Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory (CTIO) in Chile, each location hosts four 14-cm Nikon telephoto lenses with a 2k $\times$ 2k thinned CCD \citep{Brown13}. The telescopes have a $4.5\times4.5$ degree field-of-view and a 7$\farcs$8 pixel scale. ASAS-SN obtained 799 observations of GW Ori from UT 2014 December 16 until UT 2017 March 15, with a typical per point error of 0.01 mag.


\section{Analysis and Results}

\subsection{A Reconstruction of the Disk Velocity Field}
\label{sec:disk}
We use the spatially and spectrally resolved molecular line emission observed with ALMA to tomographically reconstruct the disk velocity field and make a dynamical measurement of the total stellar mass. We follow the forward modeling procedures described by \citet{czekala15a,czekala16} using the associated open-source software package {\tt DiskJockey}.\footnote{Available under an MIT license at \url{https://github.com/iancze/DiskJockey}.}

\begin{figure*}[ht!]

  \includegraphics{chmaps_13CO.pdf}
  \figcaption{A comparison of the observed channel maps of the $^{13}$CO line emission ({\it top}) with a best-fit model ({\it middle}; constructed from a synthetic visibility set based on the inferred parameters listed in Table~\ref{table:components} and then imaged in the same way as the data) and the associated residuals ({\it bottom}; the imaged data$-$model residual visibilities).  The annotation is the same as in Fig.~\ref{fig:chanmaps}.
  \label{fig:13co}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

The basis of the parametric physical model adopted in this approach is a radial surface density profile, $\Sigma(r)$, designed to mimic a simple theoretical description for a viscous accretion disk \citep{lyndenbell74,hartmann98}.  It decreases like $1/r$ interior to a characteristic radius $R_c$, and has an exponential taper $e^{-r/R_c}$ at larger radii.  The vertical distribution ($z$-direction) of these densities is controlled by the disk temperatures. To convert the total gas densities to molecule-specific values, we start with baseline abundances that are representative of the cold molecular interstellar medium: [H$_2$/ gas] = 0.8, [$^{12}$CO/H] = $7.5 \times 10^{-5}$, [$^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO] = 69, and [$^{12}$CO/C$^{18}$O] = 557 \citep[e.g.,][]{henkel94,prantzos96}.

\begin{figure*}[ht!]

  \includegraphics{chmaps_C18O.pdf}
  \figcaption{A comparison of the observed channel maps of the C$^{18}$O line emission ({\it top}) with a best-fit model ({\it middle}; constructed from a synthetic visibility set based on the inferred parameters listed in Table~\ref{table:components} and then imaged in the same way as the data) and the associated residuals ({\it bottom}; the imaged data$-$model residual visibilities).  The annotation is the same as in Fig.~\ref{fig:chanmaps}.
  \label{fig:c18o}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

% We then follow \citet{qi08} to crudely account for depletions relative to these baselines associated with both photodissociation in the low-density atmosphere and freezeout onto dust grains at low temperatures.  Specifically, we set the CO abundance to zero for regions where the gas column densities (vertically integrated toward the midplane) are below $10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$, and we deplete the baseline abundance by a factor of 100 for the disk regions where $T<19$\,K.

The disk kinematics are assumed to be Keplerian and dominated by the total stellar mass $M_\mathrm{tot}$, with a velocity field that appropriately accounts for the two-dimensional distribution of the emitting layer \citep[see][]{rosenfeld13a}.  The  line-spread function is characterized with a width defined by the quadrature sum of thermal and non-thermal ($\xi$; presumably turbulent) contributions. For any physical structure specified by these 6 parameters, \{$\Sigma_c$, $R_c$, $T_{10}$, $q$, $M_\mathrm{tot}$, $\xi$\}, we solve the molecular rate equations (assuming LTE) and ray-trace the associated emission into a set of high resolution channel maps using the radiative transfer package {\tt RADMC-3D} \citep{dullemond12}.
That ray-tracing requires that we specify 3 additional geometric parameters: the disk inclination to the line-of-sight ($i_\mathrm{disk}$), the position angle of the disk rotation axis projected on the sky ($\varphi$), and the LSRK systemic radial velocity ($v_r$). Hereafter, we term this parameterization the ``standard'' model. The model channel maps are then Fourier transformed and sampled at the same spatial frequencies observed by ALMA.  The model quality with respect to the observed visibilities is evaluated with a $\chi^2$ likelihood function that incorporates the nominal visibility weights.
We assume flat priors on all parameters except for $i_\mathrm{disk}$, where we adopt a simple geometric prior \citep[the disk angular momentum vector
${\bm h}_\mathrm{disk}$ is distributed uniformly on a sphere, e.g.;][]{czekala16}. We adopt a fixed distance to GW Ori of $d = 388\,$pc \citep{kounkel17} to make the problem more computationally tractable; we discuss the effects of this assumption in Section~\ref{sec:joint}. The posterior distribution of these parameters is explored using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations with the affine invariant ensemble sampler proposed by \citet{goodman10}, as implemented in the {\tt emcee} code \citep{foreman-mackey13} and ported to the {\tt Julia} programming language, which we include in {\tt DiskJockey}.

Compared to our previous similar work, the modeling of \obj\ is considerably more computationally intensive. This is primarily a consequence of the large physical size of the disk, which makes the ray-tracing step substantially more time-consuming. The inference for an individual spectral line takes $\sim$10,000 CPU hours parallelized across 26 cores on the Harvard Odyssey Cluster.  Given that restriction and the fact that the $^{12}$CO line is clearly contaminated by local cloud material, we restrict our analysis to {\it independent} inferences of the model parameters based on the $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O data only. For computational expediency we only model the data averaged to 25 channels of $0.4\,\kms$ width. Experiments modeling a subset of the channels at higher resolution (e.g., every third channel) did not yield a significantly different result.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The inferred parameter values corresponding to the measurements of each spectral line are summarized together in Table~\ref{table:components}.  A comparison of the data and the best-fit models (and associated residuals) is presented in the form of channel maps in Figures~\ref{fig:13co} and \ref{fig:c18o} for $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O, respectively.  While overall the models successfully reproduce the observed emission, there are some interesting residuals. Namely, an excess of emission in the center of the disk for the channels between $13.1 - 14.3\,\kms$, seen in both \thirteen\ and \eighteen. We will return to a discussion of a potential origin in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

Motivated by the presence of the aforementioned residuals, we explored more sophisticated disk models, including a model with a vertical temperature gradient and CO depletion due to freeze-out and photodissociation \citep[after][]{rosenfeld13a}, as well as a flexible temperature model parameterized to mimic more sophisticated (and computationally expensive) protoplanetary disk models \citep{kamp04,jonkheid04}. However, we found that neither of these models resulted in a more satisfactory fit to the data as measured by visual inspection and the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Encouragingly, however, they still yielded similar estimates of $M_\mathrm{tot}$ as the standard model, which gives us confidence that the disk-based dynamical mass is moderately robust to choice of parameterization for the temperature and density structures.

Using the standard model, the inferred physical structures inferred from each line are in mild disagreement, as might be expected for this simple parameterization. To illustrate these differences, we plot the 2D temperature and density profiles inferred from each transition in Figure~\ref{fig:temp_dens}. We attribute these differences to the different layers of the disk probed by the \thirteen\ and \eighteen\ transitions. In Figure~\ref{fig:posterior}, we plot the marginalized posteriors for both transitions in the \{$M_\ast$, $i_\mathrm{disk}$\}-plane. Interestingly, the different transitions deliver different inclinations at a statistically significant level ($\Delta i_\mathrm{disk} \approx 2.5^\circ$), which we attribute to the previously mentioned model deficiencies and the fact that the \thirteen\ and \eighteen\ transitions probe different layers in the disk.
This difference is potentially concerning because biases in the measurement of disk inclination have the greatest potential to affect the inference of $M_\mathrm{tot}$. With more computational power, it would be worthwhile to explore a joint fit to both transitions, to see if a single disk structure could adequately fit both transitions simultaneously.
Nevertheless, both transitions yield consistent constraints on the total stellar mass, which is the most relevant parameter to our stated goals. We believe that the robustness of the dynamical mass technique is primarily because the kinematic morphology of the line emission (i.e., the location of the emission in R.A., Dec., and radial velocity space) is not strongly dependent on the exact temperature and density structure of the disk, but is rather a strong function of $M_\mathrm{tot}$ and $i_\mathrm{disk}$, and when the disk is spatially resolved, the dependence on $i_\mathrm{disk}$ is diminished. We combine the inferred total masses from \thirteen\ and \eighteen\ in a weighted mean to get $M_\mathrm{tot} = 5.29 \pm 0.06\,M_\odot$.
The uncertainty in the distance to \obj\ \citep[$388 \pm 5\,$pc;][]{kounkel17} linearly translates into a mass uncertainty, and so we convolve an additional 1.3\% mass uncertainty with this posterior to get  $M_\mathrm{tot} = 5.29 \pm 0.09\,M_\odot$, which we adopt as our reported total mass estimate. Because the inferred disk inclinations are mutually inconsistent, we adopt a weighted average for the mean inclination and assume a large systematic uncertainty, resulting in a final estimate of $i_\mathrm{disk} = 137.6 \pm 2.0^\circ$. Our CO results are broadly consistent with that determined by \citet{fang17}, who measure the disk inclination to be $\sim 35^\circ$.

% they say the disk inclination is ~35 degrees. We also slightly disagree with this, since we have i = 137 degrees = 43 degrees. This is close enough, though.
% Fang determines the disk is in Keplerian rotation, due to analysis of the 12CO maps. Substantial inclination to our line of sight.
% From the 12CO modeling, they get i = 40 degrees, and PA = 10 degrees. The PA convention must be offset from us, so its discrepancy is actually somewhat significant (we determine 90 degrees, so this is 10 degrees offset).
% Fit the 12CO only. Then they see that 13CO agrees, but C18O is too faint by a factor of three. Dust absorption of the line emission could be a factor

\subsection{An Updated Model of the Stellar Orbits} \label{sec:orbit}
In this section, we first discuss our orbital fit to the RVs determined in \S\ref{subsec:spectroscopy}, and then explore a joint RV + astrometric fit which includes the three epochs of astrometry in \citet{berger11}.
We fit a hierarchical triple orbit and solve for the elements of the inner and outer Keplerian orbits simultaneously, assuming the inner binary acts as a point mass in the outer orbit. To address possible systematic offsets present in the RV dataset, we fit for three offset terms: 1) $\Delta v$ TRES,  applied as a shift to all TRES RVs to account for the offset of the instrumental RV zeropoint 2) $\Delta v_2$ Reticon and 3) $\Delta v_2$ TRES, offsets which are applied to the secondary RVs to account for possible offset velocities due to template mismatch between the synthetic spectrum used as a cross-correlation template and the true spectrum of the secondary star. The residuals from our initial fit indicated our formal velocity errors are underestimated, and so the uncertainties on each data point are scaled until the final reduced $\chi_\nu^2 = 1$ for our final solution.

The period of the inner orbit is consistent with that of \citet{mathieu91,fang14}; however, due to the SB2 nature of the system, most other orbital parameters have significantly changed. We find a larger semi-amplitude for the primary, $K_{\rm A} = 8.36 \pm 0.14~\kms$, a mass ratio of $q \equiv M_\mathrm{B} / M_\mathrm{A} = 0.60 \pm 0.02$, and a statistically significant eccentricity $e_\mathrm{in} = 0.13 \pm 0.02$.
We find the outer orbit has an orbital period of $P_\mathrm{out} = 4218 \pm 60$ days, or 11.5 years, and a statistically significant eccentricity, $e_\mathrm{out} = 0.22 \pm 0.09$. We find offset terms statistically inconsistent with zero: a small but non-negligable offset between the Reticon and TRES zeropoints of $0.49\;\kms$ and larger offsets for the secondary velocities of $8.77\;\kms$ and $6.41\;\kms$, for the Reticon and TRES RVs, respectively. Given the large intrinsic linewidth ($v \sin i \approx 40\;\kms$), these large offsets can reasonably be ascribed to template mismatch. All parameters of the RV fit are listed in the first column of Table~\ref{tab:elements} and the full orbit as a function of time is shown in the second panel of Figure~\ref{fig:orbitboth}.
Graphical representations of our observations and the inner and outer orbit models as a function of orbital phase are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:orbitin} and Figure~\ref{fig:orbitout}, respectively.

Although there are only three epochs of published astrometry in \citet{berger11}, these points may still considerably constrain the parameter space of possible orbits. Therefore, we explore a joint RV-astrometric analysis built upon a model of the ``three-dimensional orbit'' following \citet{murray10}, which adds new model parameters like semi-major axis, orbital inclination, and position angle of the ascending node for both inner and outer orbits. For a likelihood function, we combine the $\chi^2$ RV likelihood and a new $\chi^2$ likelihood for the separation and azimuth measurements of the B and C components relative to the position of A. As with the disk analysis, we also use a geometric prior on the orbital inclinations. For their last measurement epoch (2005), \citet{berger11} report an alternate position for the C component, and so we also perform a separate fit as if this were the true location of C.
The newly constrained parameters are in the second and third columns of Table~\ref{tab:elements}, and a graphical representation of the orbit is in Figure~\ref{fig:astro}.
With the addition of the astrometric dataset, we are able to constrain the individual stellar masses and the inclinations of the orbital planes, which are also listed in Table~\ref{tab:elements}. Depending on whether the original or alternate position for C is used, we find the total stellar mass to be $M_\mathrm{tot} = 5.7 \pm 0.7\,M_\odot$ or $M_\mathrm{tot} = 6.1 \pm 0.9\,M_\odot$, respectively. Both measurements are nicely consistent with the $M_\mathrm{tot}$ independently measured by the disk-based analysis ($M_\mathrm{tot} = 5.29 \pm 0.09\,M_\odot$).

\end{figure*}

To measure the degree of misalignment between the orbital planes and the circumtriple disk, we calculate the angle $\Phi$ between the angular momentum vectors of each orbit according to \citet{fekel81}
\begin{equation}
  \cos \Phi = \cos i_1 \cos i_2 + \sin i_1 \sin i_2 \cos(\Omega_1 - \Omega_2).
\end{equation}
We find that the mutual inclination between the disk and the inner stellar orbit is $\Phi_\mathrm{in} = 44\pm5^\circ$ and the mutual inclination between the disk and the outer stellar orbit is $\Phi_\mathrm{out} = 54\pm 7^\circ$; these values are similar if one uses the ``alternate'' C position ($\Phi_\mathrm{in} = 45 \pm 5^\circ$, $\Phi_\mathrm{out} = 50 \pm 6^\circ$). Such a large misalignment is surprising given the naive expectation that the stellar orbits and disk would be roughly co-planar.  Since these results only rest upon three astrometric epochs, however, there is a possibility that the large inferred mutual inclinations may be the result of unaccounted for systematic effects. In the next section, we use only the newly derived RVs and disk inclination to formulate a more conservative estimate of the mutual inclinations. We advocate continued astrometric monitoring of the \obj\ system to further improve the three-dimensional orbit and definitively confirm the inclinations of the stellar orbits.

\subsection{Joint Radial Velocity and Disk Constraints on Individual Component Masses}
\label{sec:joint}
In this section, we combine the double-lined RV constraints with the disk-based constraints on the total stellar mass to form an independent constraint on the individual stellar masses of the \obj\ system without referencing the \citet{berger11} astrometry. We construct a joint likelihood function with the following five parameters: $M_\mathrm{A}$, $M_\mathrm{B}$, $M_\mathrm{C}$, $i_\mathrm{in}$, and $i_\mathrm{out}$.
The double-lined radial velocity constraints are sufficiently captured by the summary statistics $M_\mathrm{A} \sin^3 i_\mathrm{in}$, $M_\mathrm{B} \sin^3 i_\mathrm{in}$, $M_\mathrm{C} \sin i_\mathrm{out} / (M_\mathrm{tot} / M_\odot)^{2/3}$ and the covariances between them, which are well represented by a multivariate Gaussian distribution.\footnote{Note that we do not use additional constraints on $q_\mathrm{in}$ or other derived parameters, as this would amount to double-counting the RV constraints.} The disk constraint on the total stellar mass $M_\mathrm{tot}$ is well-represented by a Gaussian, as well.
We enforce flat priors on the stellar masses and geometrical priors on the inclinations. We use the ensemble sampler MCMC \citep{goodman10,foreman-mackey13} with 20 walkers to explore the posterior for 50,000 iterations, burn 25,000 iterations, and assess convergence by ensuring the Gelman-Rubin statistic \citep{gelman14} is $\hat{R} < 1.1$ for all parameters.

This solution would be inconsistent with the astrometric motion, however, so we opt to only report the solutions with $i \geq 90^\circ$.}

\end{figure}

This analysis produces consistent but less precise constraints on the stellar masses as the joint RV + astrometric fits (see Table~\ref{table:component_masses}). Like the RV + astrometric analysis, the disk + RV analysis also indicates that the inner stellar orbit must be significantly misaligned with the disk, although the true misaligment is unknown since the difference between $i_\mathrm{in}$ and $i_\mathrm{disk}$ only provides a lower limit on the mutual inclination because the true mutual inclination must consider the position angles of the orbits as well. To highlight these findings, we overplot our newly derived constraints on the disk inclination and the stellar orbits in Figure~\ref{fig:incl_posterior}.
At the lowest inclinations (nearest to edge-on, $i = 90^\circ$) are the measurements for the disk in \thirteen\ and \eighteen. This is commensurate with the disk inclination measurements from \citet{fang17}, and so we consider these results to be robust.
Interestingly, the constraints on $i_\mathrm{in}$ differ between the RV + astrometry and the RV + disk results at a significant level. We speculate that this difference might be due to unknown systematics in the astrometry or RV datasets, or potentially an error in our assumption of the distance to \obj. While the astrometry + RV analysis does not require a distance to the source, the disk-based analysis does require a distance in order to break the $M_\mathrm{tot} / d$ degeneracy. Although the exact degree of mutual inclination between the inner orbit and the disk is unknown, we conclude that it is likely that it is at least $10^\circ$ and potentially as high as $45^\circ$. The RV + disk constraints on the outer orbit are less precise, but also suggest that the planes are at least somewhat misaligned.


\subsection{Disentangling the \obj\ Double-lined Spectroscopic Binary}
\label{subsec:disentangle}
As we noted in \S\ref{subsec:spectroscopy}, at optical wavelengths \obj\ clearly appears to be a \emph{single}-lined spectroscopic system, despite full coverage of the 240 day inner period at moderate to high S/N \citep{mathieu91,fang14}. In this context, the \citet{berger11} H-band detections of the secondary and tertiary stars at favorable flux ratios ($f_B / f_A = 0.57 \pm 0.05$ and $f_C / f_A = 0.23 \pm 0.01$) were rather puzzling, since such a bright secondary companion should have detectable optical signatures. We originally embarked on a search for these signatures using the then-under-development \texttt{PSOAP} spectroscopic disentangling package \citep{czekala17}, with a strong assumption that these spectral signatures must be at or near the detection limit (e.g., $q_\mathrm{in} \lesssim 0.2$), since they had not been seen in previous analyses. Our preliminary results hinted at the detection of a secondary spectrum, but with mass ratios much larger than what we had expected ($q_\mathrm{in} > 0.5$). Because the algorithm was still under development, we discounted these initial results as spurious and possibly the result of contamination by stellar variability.
To our excitement, however, shortly thereafter we learned that \obj\ had been revealed as a \emph{double}-lined spectroscopic binary using targeted high resolution infrared spectroscopy ($q_\mathrm{in} \sim 0.65$, L. Prato, private communication, March 2017). Using this knowledge, we renewed our efforts to search for the secondary signature using \texttt{PSOAP} and targeted \texttt{TODCOR} analysis.


The \texttt{PSOAP} spectroscopic disentangling technique works as an inference framework. Given a time-series of high resolution spectroscopic observations covering the orbital phase of the binary or triple star, it simultaneously infers the intrinsic spectrum of each star along with the stellar orbit. \texttt{PSOAP} uses Gaussian processes to model the unknown stellar spectra, providing a robust probabalistic framework by which the spectra and orbits can be inferred in a purely data-driven manner. Once disentangled, these spectra can be used to infer fundamental stellar properties by traditional analysis techniques. For more information on the mathematical details of \texttt{PSOAP} please consult \citet{czekala17}. At present, one limitation of the \texttt{PSOAP} framework (and Gaussian processes in general, to some extent) is the heavy computational requirement for performing the matrix calculations. This generally limits us to considering less than 20 epochs of high resolution spectra at a time, which consequentially limits the complexity of the orbital model that we can use. Although it was straightforward to extend the framework to utilize a hierarchical triple orbital model and three Gaussian process components, we found that we were unable to employ enough spectroscopic epochs to sufficiently constrain the more complex orbital model. Therefore, we experimented using different subsets of the data to test our sensitivity to presence of secondary and tertiary spectral signatures. In all of these tests, we clearly detected the features of the secondary but found no solid evidence for spectroscopic signatures of the tertiary. We have identified possible avenues of development to expand the number of spectroscopic epochs under consideration, but exploring these options will require development and testing beyond the scope of this paper.

While \texttt{PSOAP} unfortunately has a limited ability to constrain the orbital parameters of \obj, it can still provide disentangled spectra of the primary and secondary stars. To work around the epoch limit, we selected the 16 highest SNR spectra in the narrow date range of JD 2455826 to 2456052, which covers $\sim 95$\% of the inner orbital period and both quadrature phases while being minimally sensitive to the longer term radial velocity trend due to the tertiary. To converge the binary orbital model to an adequate set of orbital parameters, we use 40\,\AA\ of spectra containing many deep absorption lines between 5160 and 5200\,\AA\ broken up into 5\,\AA\ chunks. We note that this set of orbital parameters (which we do not report) is likely incorrect given the triple nature of the system, but since we used a narrow range of data, the predicted radial velocities of the primary and secondary should be sufficiently accurate. Using this set of orbital and Gaussian process parameters, we disentangle a wider wavelength range of data covering 5060 - 5290\AA. This overlaps with the wavelength range of a tuned CfA version of the Kurucz models, which has been used for extensive radial velocity analysis and is tuned for solar-like stars \citep{buchhave12}.
The disentangled spectra are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:disentangled}, overlaid with two representative \citet{husser13} models using the same stellar parameters as determined by the cross-correlation analysis described in \S\ref{subsec:spectroscopy}.

In general, an inherent limitation of disentangling techniques is that they are unable to provide any information on the flux ratios of the components: they are only able to provide the relative amplitudes of the spectral variations. Essentially, there emerges a degeneracy between a bright companion star with shallow spectral lines and a faint companion star with deep spectral lines. Therefore, in order to re-normalize\footnote{Note that this is \emph{not} continuum normalization in the traditional sense (e.g. dividing by a spline fit to the stellar continuum), but simply a constant scaling by a ratio defined in \citet[Eqn. 32]{czekala17} which preserves broad-scale shapes intrinsic to the spectra.} the disentangled spectra to compare with synthetic models, we must assume a flux ratio between the two stars.
In light of this, the process of inferring stellar parameters becomes rather difficult, especially since both \obj~A and \obj~B may suffer from veiling and both the re-normalization and veiling affect the ``contrast'' level of the spectra. Over this narrow wavelength range, $T_\mathrm{eff}$ mainly changes the depth of the lines, while $\log g$ and $v \sin i$ mainly change the shape and depth of the lines. Due to these degeneracies, we are encouraged that the disentangled look like the spectra used to derive the radial velocity solutions, but note that in reality, the stellar parameters could plausibly range by $\Delta T_\mathrm{eff} \sim 500\,$ K, $\Delta \log g \sim 0.5\,$dex, and $\Delta v \sin i \sim 10\,\kms$ in a correlated manner for each star, especially given uncertainties about the flux ratio and accretion veiling.

The top bar shows a spectrum of Vega, to demonstrate that this wavelength band is free from any telluric line contamination. The disentangled spectra have been inversely scaled by an assumed flux ratio to bring their continuum level to 1 to facilitate better comparison to the synthetic models. Disentangled spectra at the edges of echelle orders may appear jagged (e.g. $\sim 5160\,$\AA). In this figure, we have assumed the same flux ratio and stellar parameters as found by the cross-correlation analysis described in \S\ref{subsec:spectroscopy}: $f_B / f_A = 0.25$, the primary is $T_\mathrm{eff} = 5700\,$K, $\log g = 3.0\,$ dex, $v \sin i = 40\,\kms$, the secondary is $T_\mathrm{eff} = 4800\,$K, $\log g = 3.0\,$ dex, $v \sin i = 45\,\kms$.

\subsection{Periodic Dimming and Eclipses}
\label{sec:eclipses}
Using the longer baseline of our combined photometric record, we identify several new eclipse events, bringing the total number of known events to 13, the 10 of these covered by our lightcurve are listed in Table~\ref{tab:eclipses}, marked in Figure~\ref{fig:orbitboth}, and shown zoomed in Figure~\ref{fig:eclipse-gallery}. Given the sometimes considerable noise in our lightcurve, we have only identified eclipse events that show multiple consecutive photometric points deviating significantly from the running average, since a large dip in only one epoch of photometry is likely the result of a spurious observation. There are also regular seasonal gaps in the lightcurve, making it likely that many other eclipse events were missed due to lack of coverage.
The eclipse events are broadly similar in depth and duration to the events identified in \citet{shevchenko92,shevchenko98}, ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mag and between 10 to 50 days. While there are several sequential eclipse events that occur near the inner period of 241 days (e.g., the first two eclipses in 1988 and 1990 noted by \citet{shevchenko92}), our longer baseline reveals that the eclipses are not strictly periodic.
When the full lightcurve is phased to the inner period (Figure~\ref{fig:orbitin}), it becomes clear that there are a multitude of inner phases at which the eclipse events occur.
We do observe one potential brightening event, shown in the lower left panel in Figure~\ref{fig:eclipse-gallery}. Brightenings are not seen for other eclipse events, so this case may be a unique artifact present in the KELT data, especially since the ASAS-SN data, which covers from egress onward, does not show the same behavior. If this event is real, then it would indicate increased accretion or flare luminosity during the eclipse itself. If this timing were not simply a coincidence, then this would indicate a direct link between the eclipses and accretion onto the stellar surface.


Eclipses notwithstanding, the most striking mode of variability that emerges with the long baseline of our lightcurve is a 0.20 mag sinusoidal oscillation of the mean non-eclipsed flux, clearly phased with the outer orbital period of 4218 days (Figure~\ref{fig:orbitout}). We must be careful when evaluating this mode of variability, however, since it stretches across photometry acquired from several different instruments. Moreover, the KELT dataset was not taken in $V$-band but rather shifted to match the overlapping ASAS-SN observations, which means that it has limited ability to constrain this longer mode due to zeropoint uncertainty. With these caveats in mind, given that clear rising and falling trends are seen within each data set and that no vertical shifts have been applied to any other dataset, this mode is likely real. A final supporting piece of evidence is the earlier photoelectric observations of \citet{shevchenko98}, which stretch back to JD 2,445,000 and clearly phase up with the expected sinusoidal variation.
Beyond this long term variability, it does appear as if the deep eclipses do preferentially occur between phases 0.4 - 0.8 from periastron. However, when consulting the earlier baseline photometry in \citet{shevchenko98}, we find at least two additional eclipses that fall closer to 0.0 phase, suggesting that the apparent clustering of deep eclipses is an effect of the seasonal sampling in our dataset.

% \todo{See Cody et al references to: In several cases, periodic fading on longer timescales (months to years) has been traced to obscuration by a circumbinary disk precessing about a double- or triple-star system (e.g., Cohen et al. 2003; Plavchan et al. 2008a; Herbst et al. 2010; Plavchan et al. 2013). }
% Although orbital solutions are not well known for these systems.

The long period sinusoidal variability reaches minimum flux levels near apoastron (phase 0.5) of the outer orbit. Since the light from the A-B binary dominates the total optical flux from the system, it is one or both of these stars that are either being partially occulted by opaque material (e.g., the sharp edge of a dense dust ring) or more fully occulted by partially opaque material (e.g., diffuse dust). When the A-B system is at apoastron it is closest to the inner edge of the disk (see Figure~\ref{fig:astro}, top right panel), which has presumably been somewhat cleared due to the dynamical influence of the stellar components. Due to the fact that the disk is more edge-on than the stellar orbits, apoastron also happens to correspond to the time when the A-B pair comes closest to being screened by the inner edge of the near side of the disk. From dynamical arguments, we expect the inner edge of the disk to be tructated out to 2-3 times the semi-major axis of the tertiary, which corresponds to $\sim$20-30\,au in radius. Even with the foreshortening due the relative inclinations, the inner edge of the disk would be at too large of a projected distance to occult the A-B pair at apoastron, unless the disk had a very puffed up inner edge. Given the gradual dimming, it may be more likely that the A-B pair is screened by tenuous material residing inside this truncation radius, such as the micron-sized dust within the gap hinted at by the $10\mu$m silicate emission feature in \obj's SED \citep{fang14}.

By modeling the spectral energy distribution of \obj, \citet{fang14} determine that there is a variable reservoir of small grains in the center of the disk, possibly cleared and replenished due to the actions of the teritary. An outstanding question is what the disk looks like on these scales. Our ALMA observations do not have sufficient angular resolution to probe the disk at the physical scales corresponding to the orbit of the triple, although at its longest baselines, ALMA would have the spatial resolution (0.02 arcsec) to probe the disk on 8 au scales, more than sufficient to resolve an inner hole 16 au or larger in diameter.
It is also clear that the distribution of solids within the \obj\ disk is not well constrained at small radii, although the solids are constrained to be at smaller radii ($r_\mathrm{dust} \sim 600$\,au) than the gas ($r_\twelve \sim 1300\,$au). We know from the SED that it changes, and we know that many disks exhibit substructure.

Given that the $\sim$20\,day eclipse events do not significantly sync with the outer orbital period, it is not immediately clear whether they share the same physical origin as the long term brightness variations. The quasi-periodic nature of these eclipses, whereby a deep eclipse occurs and then subsequent shallower eclipses occur during the next orbit, led \citet{shevchenko98} to attribute these eclipses to an occultation by the overflowing Roche lobe of the secondary star. As the material accreted onto the secondary star, the size of the occulter diminished, and the eclipses got shallower. We now know from dynamical constraints that an edge-on A-B orbit ($i_\mathrm{in} \approx 90$ deg) is ruled out, and so we must consider other mechanisms. While do not see a series of eclipses with such striking regularity as those observed by \citet{shevchenko98}, it does appear as though consecutive eclipses may be correlated with the 241 day inner period.

Any theory that seeks to explain these inner eclipses must account for the several pieces of evidence in addition to the updated orbital configuration. Namely, the eclipses span 10 - 50 days in duration, are of variable depth between 0.1 and 0.7 magnitudes, and are not strictly periodic with the inner period, and likely can occur at all phases of the outer orbital period. Moreover, our spectra (unwittingly) taken during times of eclipse show no obvious changes in spectral features beyond the normal variability described by \citet{fang14}. For the epochs where multiple bands existed (e.g., the four eclipses in the Maidanak dataset, which also includes B, R, and noisey U measurements) the eclipse duration was similar in all bands. The star appears slightly redder during eclipse ($\Delta (B - V)\approx 0.05$\,mag, $\Delta (V - R) \approx 0.1$\,mag), suggesting dust obscuration \todo{Does this obey any dust redenning law?}. We speculate that these quasi-periodic eclipses may be due to the presence of an unstable circumbinary disk around A and B or possibly the result of eclipses of the A star by accretion streams onto either the circumstellar disk of A or B. In this regard, the irregular eclipses in the RW~Aur system may provide an analogue to the \obj\ eclipses \citep{rodriguez16}.

Lastly, we searched for periodicty in the lightcurve beyond the inner and outer orbital periods.
After removing obvious eclipse events, we used the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodicity search algorithm \citep{lomb76,scargle82}  \citep[within the VARTOOLS analysis package;][]{Hartman:12} to search for periodic variability from 1.1 to 100 days in the high cadenced KELT observations. The top two periods we recover are 2.93 and 74.80 days, shown in Figure \ref{fig:phased}. \todo{Does 2.93 correspond to the rotation period? What about 74.80?}

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}
With the newly derived component masses now established, we turn to discussion of the photospheric properties of the stars and the age of the \obj\ system. With these in place, we discuss the system architecture in context of other triple systems and possible formation mechanisms.

\subsection{The Age and Photospheric Properties of the GW Ori Stars}
We use the spectroscopic constraints on the primary and secondary effective temperatures ($T_\mathrm{eff} = 5700 \pm 200\,\mathrm{K}$, $T_\mathrm{eff} = 4800 \pm 200\,\mathrm{K}$, respectively) and the collection of multi-band photometry in the literature \todo{\{fill in information from Keivan\}} to infer component luminosities for the A and B stars. We note that these values are \todo{\{similar/different\}} from those inferred by \citet{fang14}, who fit the \obj\ SED assuming that the contribution from the secondary light was negligible. We use the \todo{XX atmospheres} and \todo{XX} redenning laws to infer luminosities of \todo{XX} and \todo{XX} for each source.
Due to the lingering uncertainties in the orbital parameters, and thus loose constraints on the individual component masses, rather than evaluating the consistency of the pre-Main Sequence model predictions compared to these measured photospheric properties, instead we simply use the pre-Main Sequence models to guide discussion about the individual component properties and system age. In Figure~\ref{fig:PMS} we place these stars on the HR diagram along with representative stellar evolutionary tracks from the MIST models \citep{choi16}. The mass tracks start at $0.5\,M_\odot$ and increase in increments of $0.5\,M_\odot$; the isochrones are at ages of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 Myr. The positions of A and B in this diagram are \todo{\{in\}}consistent with their measured dynamical masses and indicate ages of 0.5 - 1.5 Myr. Our revised mass for \obj~A is significantly lower than those estimated by \citet{berger11,fang14}, and, combined with revising the photospheric properties based upon estimated two components, means that the inferred photospheric properties are now more consistent with a slightly older system than would otherwise be implied ($< 0.5$\,Myr if $M_\mathrm{A} > 4.0 \,M_\odot$). Even with its lower revised mass and luminosity, however, it is likely still true that \obj~A is a Herbig Ae/Be precursor \citep[as noted by][]{fang14}.

In Figure~\ref{fig:evolution}, we utilize three MIST models nearest the best-fit masses for each of the stellar components to compute the evolution of the effective temperatures and the $V$ and $H$-band flux ratios and compare these quantities to the existing photospheric measurements. Beyond the primary and secondary effective temperatures and $V$-band flux ratio reported in this work, there are two $H$-band flux ratio constraints from \citet{berger11}. Their mean $H$-band flux ratios (computed as the weighted mean of all measurements) are $f_B/f_A = 0.57 \pm 0.05$ and $f_C/f_A = 0.23 \pm 0.01$. In general, the measured effective temperatures and $V$-band flux ratio agree well with the predictions from the models in the age range 1.0 - 1.7 Myr. The predicted $H$-band flux ratios are slightly low relative to the \citet{berger11} measurements, although still within 20\% of the measured value.
The predicted $V$-band flux contribution for the C component is very small $\lesssim 10\%$, explaining why we were unable to find optical spectroscopic signatures of this component, even though it is nearly a solar mass.

As noted by \citet{berger11}, it is possible that one, two, or all three of the stars might show excess $H$-band emission due to the presence of a circumstellar disk, and/or accretion signatures above the photospheric emission of these stars. While we find that the measured photospheric properties are reasonably consistent without invoking such an excess, there is circumstantial evidence for the idea. \citep{najita03} find blended fundamental emission peaks, which \citet{bast11} suggest might actually be the blended profiles of emission originating from physically distinct regions, e.g., individual circumstellar disks around the A and B stars. It may also be possible that the CO fundamental emission is consistent with with radius at the inner edge of the circumtriple disk, cleared by the $\sim$9\,au orbit of the C component.

\subsection{The \obj\ Triple System in Context}
The many unique datasets presented in this paper have enabled us to paint a detailed picture of the \obj\ system. In this final section, we aim to place \obj\ in context with other pre-Main Sequence multiple systems and hierarchical triple systems in general. The \obj\ system is young (0.7 - 1.5 Myr), contains a considerable amount of stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{tot} = 5.29\pm0.09\,M_\odot$), and hosts a very massive disk ($M_\mathrm{disk} \approx 0.1\,M_\odot$), which makes it an extremely interesting system to study in the context of theories about star and planet formation, migration, and stability.

% Discussion about the disk mass and size in context. Toomre analysis.
We estimated the total disk mass using the results from our \thirteen\ and \eighteen\ modeling in \S\ref{sec:disk}, which we remind readers are actually indirect measurements that rely upon an uncertain conversion factor between \twelve\ and $\mathrm{H}_2$ (and to a lesser degree, the gas to dust ratio). We find slightly larger disk masses when modeling \eighteen\ compared to \thirteen. This is in conflict with the finding of \citet{fang17} that \eighteen\ must be depleted relative to \thirteen. We attribute the differences in our disk masses to insufficiently complex models of disk structure and note that in general estimating disk masses from CO is notoriously difficult \citep{yu17}. In the context of the large disk mass survey by \citet{andrews13}, \obj's disk mass is slightly larger than the mean predicted value for its stellar mass, although still consistent with the large $1\sigma$ envelope in this relationship at high stellar masses.
In light of this large disk mass, we investigate whether the disk is Toomre stable today. We use the more massive $M_\mathrm{disk}$ values from the \eighteen\ results to derive a lower bound on Toomre's Q parameter
\begin{equation}
Q = \frac{c_s \Omega}{\pi G \Sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{k_\mathrm{B} M_\mathrm{tot}}{\pi^2 \mu m_\mathrm{H} G}} \sqrt{\frac{T(r)}{r^2 \Sigma^2(r)}}.
\end{equation}
For the range of disk parameters determined from our CO fitting, the minimum value is $Q \approx 100$, which occurs far in the outer disk at $r \sim 300\,$au---the disk is not currently undergoing disk instability ($Q \approx 1$).

% Discussion of GW Ori system in context of other pre-Main Sequence multiple systems.
Now we turn to a brief discussion of a few relevant analogues to the \obj\ system. % Discussion of circumbinary disks
An exciting trend of recent disk-based dynamical mass research is the finding that there are now at least four circumbinary disks around short period eccentric binaries with periods 10-20 days and a range of stellar masses which all show alignment between the stellar orbital plane and the circumbinary disk within 3 deg: UZ~Tau~E, V4046~Sgr, AK~Sco, and DQ~Tau \citep{jensen07,rosenfeld12b,czekala15b,czekala16}. This result agrees well with the low mutual inclinations found for \emph{Kepler} circumbinary planets \citep{winn15}, and if statistically significant, has exciting implications for a large circumbinary planet occurrence rate \citep{li16}. Of course, severe selection effects are at work in both samples, and so care must be taken when extrapolating these results to the population at large. Within this context, \obj\ stands apart due to the fact that its stellar orbit is \emph{not} aligned with the disk. This may be a consequence of the larger stellar masses involved, the longer orbital period, and/or the presence of a tertiary. Here we examine several other longer period systems which show significantly non-zero mutual inclinations, and show that the large mutual inclinations found in \obj\ are also present to some degree in several other longer period systems.

KH 15D is at a slightly longer period than the aforementioned systems, it is an eccentric ($e=0.6$) binary on a 48 day period which hosts a circumbinary dust ring misaligned by 10 - 20 deg from the stellar orbit \citep{chiang04,capelo12}. The precession of this ring causes the eclipses to come and go, and the sharp outer edge of the disk leads to the idea that the ring is confined to a narrow region by a planet at 4\,au. The disk and stellar orbital misalignement may be driven by dynamical interactions between the eccentric binary and the disk \citep[e.g.,]{martin17,zanazzi17}.

Moving to still larger orbital separations, the prevalence of disk-stellar orbital alignment becomes less clear, mainly due to incomplete orbital coverage due to longer periods. Consider GG~Tau~A, which is a triple system with circumstellar disks around each of three components as well as a larger circumtriple disk. The circumtriple disk is comprised of a dense ring containing 80\% of the mass and an outer disk extending up to 800\,au in size in \thirteen, and is of similar mass to that of the \obj\ disk \citep[$0.12\,M_\odot$;][]{guilloteau99}. The stellar architecture of GG~Tau~A is rather different than \obj, however. The primary star Aa is $0.78\,M_\odot$, which is in an ``outer'' orbit with another binary, Ab1 - Ab2, which together have a combined mass of less than $0.7\,M_\odot$ \citep{dutrey16}. The orbital elements of the triple system still have some uncertainty, but \citet{nelson16} make a convincing dynamical argument that the outer orbit has a semi-major axis of 62\,au and is likely coplanar with the outer circumtriple ring. Further astrometric observations are required to definitively confirm this low mutual inclination.

Recently, the massive transition disk system HD~142527 ($M_\ast = 2.0\,M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{disk} \sim 0.1\,M_\odot$) was discovered to have a M dwarf companion orbiting inside its large disk cavity \citep{biller12,lacour16}. The presence of this companion provides a possible explanation for why a smaller, inner disk in this system appears to be highly misaligned \citep[$\sim$70 deg][]{avenhaus14,marino15}, which may be driven by secular precession resonance between the disk and the companion \citep{owen17}. The extreme mass ratio of 10-20 between the M dwarf and the primary puts the HD~142527 system in a different class of multiple star systems than those we have considered so far. Even though the system parameters do not map directly to sources like \obj, these dynamical effects are still important to consider, especially since there is usually not sufficient observational sensitivity to detect such small companions for most sources (\obj\ included).

At younger ages, the Class 1 binary system L1551 IRS 5 is an interesting analogue because it hosts a large circumbinary disk \citep[$r\sim500$\,au, $M_\mathrm{disk} \approx 0.07 \,M_\odot$;][]{eisner12,takakuwa17} outside of two circumstellar disks. The binary is on a wide orbit ($a = 70\,\mathrm{au}$), to which the circumstellar disks are misaligned by up to 25 degrees. However, the circumstellar disks are probably aligned with the rotation of the outer circumbinary envelope, which may indicate that the stars were formed by rotationally-driven fragmentation, preserving this orientation \citep{lim16}. Surprisingly, Keplerian models of the central stellar mass suggest that only $0.8\,M_\odot$ is required to explain the rotational velocity of the circumbinary disk, so the particulars of this system differ from \obj\ in meaningful ways. Another binary system with misaligned protoplanetary disks (though no circumbinary disk) is HK~Tau \citep{jensen14}. Although the stellar orbit is wide ($\sim$386\,au separation) and not yet well defined, the current geometry indicates that at least one and possibly both protoplanetary disks are misaligned with the stellar orbit, likely as a result of their formation rather than any subsequent dynamical evolution.

The most recent example of a misaligned circumbinary disk is in the TWA~3A system \citep{kellog17}, which hosts a circumbinary disk within a hierarchical triple system of stars of near equal mass (SpTs M3 - M4). Aa-Ab on a 35 day eccentric $e=0.63$ orbit. A-B is on a 200-800 year orbit, possibly eccentric. Although the absolute inclinations are not yet constrained due to incomplete astrometric coverage of the orbit, the parameter space is constrained such that all three planes are likely misaligned by at least 30 degrees. The Aa-Ab circumbinary disk mutual inclination may be attributable to torques on the disk incurred by the distant B companion.

Of all these T~Tauri sources surveyed, \obj\ remains the largest in terms of stellar mass. The configuration of \obj\ is relatively difficult to probe via traditional detection techniques, requiring sustained, long-term radial velocity monitoring over 35 years, as well as sophisticated care and attention to derive a radial velocity solution for such a blended source. Morever, sustained campaigns of astrometric monitoring are necessary to close orbits. And, finally, resolved submm interferometric observations were necessary to measure the inclination of the circumtriple disk.

Although there may still be significant dynamical evolution in the architecture of the \obj\ system before it reaches the Main Sequence, it is worth briefly considering how its orbital parameters compare to the general population of triple stars. Among late B star primaries (which \obj~A will be on the main sequence), 13\% of systems have multiplicity of three or higher \citep{eggleton08}; this fraction is roughly constant across spectral types B--G. In a detailed analysis of higher-order multiple systems, \citet{tokovinin97} found that the ratio $P_\mathrm{long} / P_{\rm short}$ in almost all systems was greater than 10, presumably reflecting which orbits are stable. While \obj's ratio (17) is smaller than in many hierarchical systems, it is not an outlier among triple systems.
\citet{tokovinin97,tokovinin17} find that the distribution of mutual inclinations of the orbits in triple systems is inconsistent both with complete alignment of the inner and outer orbits (zero mutual inclination) as well as completely independent inclinations (randomly distributed).
For triples with outer projected separation $< 50\,$au the average misalignment is 20 degrees; orbits wider than 1000 au are not aligned. \citet{tokovinin17} notes that accretion of gas with randomly aligned angular momentum at the epoch of star formation can cause misaligned triples. However, we should note that this is for a population of much older systems, in which significant dynamical evolution could have occurred, particularly for the shorter-period systems.

How did the stars in the \obj\ system form?

\cite{bate12} says that tight binaries probably formed via fragmentation further out, and then decay through orbital decay through dynamical interactions, accretion, and the interaction of the circumstellar disks. Of the triples that form in his simulation, most are misaligned with each other.

Given that we don't know any of the circumstellar disks around each of the stars, yet we do know that at least one source is accreting, then this would make for a worthwhile study, to resolve the disks, their inclinations, and compare them to the outer disk. Gas allows disipative stellar encounters. Perhaps these also resulted in the inclined orbit. The relatively low eccentricities for the binary and triple need to be taken into account. \citet{bate12} notes that eccentricities $e < 0.1\,$au are rare for periods larger than 100 days \citep{raghavan10}.
Rather, it is likely that they formed via turbulent core fragmentation \citep{offner10}. Especially since all the stars do not appear to be coplanar.
