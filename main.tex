\section{Introduction -- {\bf Keivan} \label{sec:intro}}

\noindent
{\bf Keivan's things to explore:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Nominal periods: AB = 240d, C = 4000d.
\item Evolution of 5 Msun star from PMS tracks?? What age constraints are there from 5 Msun with late-G spectral type?
\item Where does the nominal 5 Myr age for lambda Ori come from (see Dolan papers)?
\item Is position and gamma velocity consistent with lambda Ori membership? Could it be in foreground Ori association?
\item Other systems that are HAeBe primary, T Tauri secondary, and tertiary -- or main sequence equivalents? (Nominal masses are 5, 0.5, 0.5 Msun). See Maxwell Moe papers (B stars with TTS companions).
\item Dimmings like RW Aur, with associated RV deviations --- Shevchenko papers.
\item KELT dimmings??
\item There is a parallax and also proper motions.
\item Tertiary has been seen by Berger et al 2011... flux ratios.
\item Fang 2014 -- VLT spectra, accretion line diagnostics, SED modeling, disk wind? Gap flows.
\item X-ray source?
\end{itemize}

We model the molecular line emission with the \texttt{DiskJockey} package \citep{czekala15a}\footnote{Open source under an MIT license at \url{URLHERE}.}. Owing to the excellent quality of the ALMA data, we extend the package to include a model with a vertical temperature gradient.

This means that while most equations are similar as in \citep{rosenfeld12b}, we have modified the temperature parameterization to include a power law for the midplane temperature and one at larger heights in the disk, the ``atmospheric'' temperature, with a smooth transition in between.

The radial density structure is set by the surface density prescription $\Sigma(r)$, where the vertical density structure is determined by solving the equation for hydrostatic equilibrium.

We also include CO freezeout, where the CO abundance is decreased by a factor of XX when the disk temperature falls below $19\,$K. We include a photodissociation threshold, wherever the column density of gas above a height is below XX, we decrease the CO abundance to zero.

We choose to fit with the distance to the source fixed at $d=414\,$pc, in order to save computational time. Distance uncertainty folds in linearly.

\subsection{Spectroscopic Observations}

TRES and Digital Spedometer Observations.

\subsection{Photometric Observations}

Photometry from Grankin, KELT.

\section{Analysis and Results}

\subsection{CO Disk Modeling}

% Discussion of why we are using a model with vertical temperature gradient, does better job of explaining disk residuals.

% Inferred central mass
% Discussion of fit residuals
% Agreement across transitions

\subsection{Updated Spectroscopic Orbit}

RV variation of ~8-10 km/s coincides with an eclipse of ~0.6 mags in R, roughly gray. Might be caused by a knife-edge that has asymmetry wrt rotation axis (R-M effect).

\subsection{GW Ori as a triple system}

{\it Some notes from Eric from reading literature on what is known about triple systems.  Is this extreme?}

While the ratio between the outer orbital period and the inner orbital period is smaller than in many hierarchical systems, it is not an outlier among triple systems.  In a detailed analysis of higher-order multiple systems, \citet{tokovinin97} found that the ratio $P_{\rm long} / P_{\rm short}$ in almost all systems was greater than 10, presumably reflecting which orbits are stable.  In GW Ori, this ratio is 16.

(Tokovinin has an updated catalog on his website with about twice as many systems as in the CDS version from this paper, but it would be non-trivial to figure out how to remake the above plot.  Not sure it's necessary.)

Among late B star primaries (which GW Ori Aa will be on the main sequence), 13\% of systems have multiplicity of three or higher \citep{eggleton08}; this fraction is roughly constant across spectral types B--G.

\citet{tokovinin97} finds that the distribution of mutual inclinations of the orbits in triple systems is inconsistent both with complete alignment of the inner and outer orbits, but also with independent inclinations of the two orbits.  However, we should note that this is for a population of much older systems, in which significant dynamical evolution could have occurred, particularly for the shorter-period systems.  The fact that GW Ori appears to have roughly-aligned, circular inner and outer orbits (!! does it?  to be confirmed) is suggestive of formation of one or both companions from the massive disk surrounding the system.  (Wild speculation here.)

Offner et al 2010 is probably important for us to look at regarding fragmentation vs.\ disk instability.  They also cite Howe \& Clarke 2009 for a review of observations.

Bate 2012 on his big fragmentation simulation: ``In particular, despite the fact that no objects form closer than $\approx 10$ au from each other, at the end of the calculation there exist 21 binary systems and one triple system with separations $<10$ au.''

In his simulations, of the triples that form, the orbits are misaligned with each other (though three are $\leq 6$ degrees, and 8 out of 9 are $\leq 36$ degrees).

Bate:  ``Observations also indicate that eccentricities $e < 0.1$ are rare for periods greater than $\approx$ 100 d (separations $\gtrsim$ 1 au). Raghavan et al. (2010) find no binaries with $e < 0.1$ and orbital periods greater than 100 d, though they do find that the outer orbits of two triples and one quadruple have $e < 0.1$. Duquennoy \& Mayor (1991) and Raghavan et al. (2010) also find that the upper-eccentricity envelope is dominated by components of triple systems, possibly due to the action of the Kozai mechanism (Kozai 1962).''

Important for us to see what constraints we have on eccentricity of the orbits.
